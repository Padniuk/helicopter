Vladimir Putin gives an emotional speech during a ceremony beginning the accession of the two Donbass republics and the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions into Russia. A big event is being held on Red Square in central Moscow, to mark the occasion. Ukraine asks for accelerated NATO membership. But the Alliance's chief says the main goal of the body is not Kiev's accession. Damage to the Nord Stream gas pipelines appears to have been caused by direct attacks from Western powers. That's the claim of the Russian president, who accused the West of sabotaging Europe's energy infrastructure.

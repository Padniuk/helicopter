This is the new Babi Yar,” Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko said, referring to the site of multiple Nazi massacres in which nearly 34,000 Ukrainian Jews were killed in 1941.“Then Hitler killed Jews, Roma and Slavs. And now Putin is destroying Ukrainians. He has already killed tens of thousands of civilians in Mariupol,” he added. “This requires a strong reaction from the entire world. We need to stop the genocide by any means possible.”In a separate statement earlier Thursday, Boychenko alleged the Russians had dug huge trenches near Manhush, 20 kilometres west of Mariupol, and were “hiding their war crimes” by dumping bodies there.On Thursday evening, Ukrainian media published satellite photos of Manhush, showing what they said were mass graves similar to - although much larger in size from - the ones discovered in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha. The accuracy of these claims and images could not be immediately verified.A private U.S. company said on Thursday said satellite imagery from Manhush shows a mass grave site that has expanded in recent weeks to contain more than 200 new graves.Maxar Technologies said a review of images from mid-March through mid-April indicates the expansion began between March 23-26. The site lies adjacent to an existing cemetery in the village west of Mariupol, Maxar said.(AP and Reuters)This satellite image released by Maxar Technologies on April 21, 2022, shows an overview of a cemetery and expansion of graves site on the northwestern edge of Manhush.

Vadym Boychenko, mayor of the besieged city, alleged on Thursday that the Russians had buried hundreds of civilians on the outskirts of Mariupol. This claim cannot be independently verified, with Russia saying publically that it has not targeted civilians. "The bodies started disappearing from the streets of the city,” said Boychenko during an online briefing, adding that Russia's troops were “hiding the trace of their crimes and using mass graves as one of the instruments for that.”“They are hiding their military crimes,” he continued. Boychenko said that the Russians dug huge trenches near Manhush, 20 kilometres (about 12 miles) west of Mariupol. Here they took " the bodies of the dead residents of Mariupol in trucks and throw them into those trenches.” Four people who died during the Russian occupation await burial during funerals in Bucha, on the outskirts of Kyiv, Wednesday, April 20, 2022.

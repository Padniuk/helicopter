Biden’s in-person visit was first reported by Reuters and later confirmed by a EU official.03.15.202220:01Russia leaves Council of Europe before possible expulsionRussia left the Council of Europe on Tuesday, accusing NATO and the European Union of using it as an instrument at the service of "their military-political and economic expansion in the East," the foreign affairs ministry said.The organisation is a human rights watchdog bringing 47 nations on the continent together including Russia since 1996.The withdrawal means that Russian citizens will not longer benefit from the European Court of Human Rights, the judicial arm of the Council of Europe.03.15.202219:34Turkish foreign minister to travel to MoscowTurkey’s foreign minister is travelling to Moscow as part of efforts to secure a cease-fire.Mevlut Cavusoglu would hold talks in Moscow on Wednesday before travelling to Ukraine for talks on Thursday, Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Tuesday.Erdogan also said the Polish President Andrzej Duda would be visiting Turkey on Wednesday for talks expected to focus on the crisis.Last week the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers met on the sidelines of a diplomacy forum organised by Turkey, although their talks failed to produce a breakthrough.(AP)03.15.202218:56Georgia is 'not in the same situation' as NATO countries, president tells Euronews"Georgia, having part of the territory occupied, being on the frontline, does not exactly behave exactly as a country that is a member of NATO and is protected in many different ways," Salome Zourabichvili, Georgia's president, told Euronews as she insisted that the country is not appeasing Russia in its policies."There is no need for Georgia to be putting some forms of provocation that could be used later on," she added.But Zourabichvili insisted that there is "solidarity" and "full support" for Ukraine and expressed "her admiration" for Ukrainian resistance in the face of "this terrible aggression".The invasion of Ukraine has prompted protests in Georgia, which faced a Russian invasion in 2008. There are rising fears that it could be a future target for Putin.The government sped up an application for EU membership following Russia's invasion of Ukraine."I'm very hopeful that there will be a new window of opportunity that will be less bureaucratic, more political," for joining the EU, Zourabichvili told Euronews.She said that Georgia needed to maintain ties with the European Union and unity within the country.Watch the full interview here: 03.15.202217:45Russia's anti-war TV protester fined 30,000 rublesA Moscow court on Tuesday ordered Marina Ovsyannikova, who interrupted a state-run TV broadcast to denounce the war in Ukraine, to pay a fine of 30,000 rubles (about €250 at the current rate), AFP reported.She was convicted of committing an administrative offence but still faces criminal charges that could put her in prison for several years.<template v-if="items" v-for="item in items | orderBy 'rank'"><div class="c-scribblelive__item"  v-bind:class="[{'c-scribblelive__item--pinned': !item.rank}]" v-bind:id="'scrbbl-item-' + item.id" data-scribblelive-id="{{item.id}}"><div class="c-scribblelive__date">

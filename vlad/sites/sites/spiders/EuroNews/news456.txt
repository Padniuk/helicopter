"I don't read anything into it until I see what their actions are."As for the negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, Biden said the consensus of Western allies is to "see what they have to offer."(AP)03.29.202220:03Cautious reaction to Ukraine-Russia talks from Western leadersThe American, French, British, German and Italian leaders were cautious after the announcement of these advances in the Russian-Ukrainian talks.Joe Biden, Emmanuel Macron, Boris Johnson, Olaf Scholz and Mario Draghi warned in a telephone conversation against any "slackening of Western resolve until the horror inflicted on Ukraine is over", according to Downing Street.They said they agreed to "continue to increase the cost paid by Russia", according to the White House.European stock markets have returned to optimism by ending up sharply.03.29.202219:55Ukraine's nuclear power plants in 'unprecedented danger' — IAEAInternational Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Mariano Grossi says the conflict is "putting Ukraine's nuclear power plants and other facilities with radioactive material in unprecedented danger".Full story here:Ukraine's nuclear power plants in 'unprecedented danger'euronews "We must take urgent action [...] to reduce the risk of a nuclear accident that could have a severe health and environmental impact both in Ukraine and beyond."03.29.202219:29Visegrad defence ministers' meeting cancelled over Hungary's stance on RussiaPoland and the Czech Republic decided not to attend due to Budapest's stance on Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Full story here:Visegrad ministers' meeting cancelled over Hungary's stance on Russia03.29.202219:00Ukraine urges countries to ban 'Z' symbolUkraine's foreign affairs minister urged countries to ban the 'Z' symbol which has been adopted by some in Russia as a symbol of support for what the Kremlin describes as a “special military operation.”"I call on all states to criminalise the use of the ‘Z’ symbol as a way to publicly support Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine," said foreign affairs minister Dmytro Kuleba."’Z’ means Russian war crimes, bombed out cities, thousands of murdered Ukrainians. Public support of this barbarism must be forbidden." Lithuanian lawmakers are currently debating a ban on use of the symbol, with people who violate it facing a fine of up to €500.

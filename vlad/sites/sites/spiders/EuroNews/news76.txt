Russia said there were 2,439 Ukrainian fighters.“Registering prisoners of war or detainees amounts to nothing short of a life insurance,” Mardini said.(AP)05.26.202218:43Prague strips Soviet commander of honorary citizenshipThe Czech capital stripped a Soviet World War II commander of his honorary Prague citizenship Thursday.The Prague City Council ’s approved Mayor Zdenek Hrib’s proposal to revoke the honour bestowed in June 1945 on Soviet Marshal Ivan Stepanovic Konev.Konev led the Red Army forces that liberated large parts of Czechoslovakia from Nazi occupation in 1945 and also contributed to Prague's liberation. He died in 1973.The mayor said the general and his army were welcomed in Prague in 1945 but he based his proposal on Konev's post-war activities.Hrib cited Konev’s authorization of a Soviet bombardment of the Czech town of Mlada Boleslav a day after World War ended, an attack which killed some 150 Czech citizens, and his role in crushing the 1956 anti-Soviet uprising in Hungary.Two years ago, a Prague district removed a statue of Konev. The action angered Russia.After communism ended in 1989, Prague authorities stripped honorary citizenship from Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.FILE - The statue of a Soviet World War II commander Marshall Ivan Stepanovic Konev is removed from its site in Prague, Czech Republic, April 3, 2020.

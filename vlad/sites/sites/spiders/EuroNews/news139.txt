As the NGO celebrates it's 40th anniversary this year, it organised its annual "umbrella march" in Lyon and many other cities across the country.Euronews Journalist, Laurence Alexandrowicz went to meet them and other NGO's fighting for the lives and rights of refugees.

"I also had a responsibility, not openly declared, but I was the oldest child of a numerous family, so it was up to me to undertake this trip to help give a future to my brothers and sisters."Yasmien Abdul Azeem, 33, fled the war in Syria and was living in Lebanon when she was among the first refugees chosen to participate in a humanitarian corridor to Italy in 2016.Since then she has worked as a cultural mediator and set up a catering business serving Syrian food."I escaped from the war, and I lived as a refugee in Lebanon for two years. It was there that I got to know the Community of Sant'Egidio, the Humanitarian Corridors, the Evangelical Church, the Friends, they proposed that we come here and start a new life because the situation was much worse, even in Lebanon, there was crisis, political conflict, many problems," she said.

No persons were injured."Police added that the fire did not break out, and the damage to the nursery has not yet been evaluated.Authorities are not ruling out that the attempted arson was politically motivated and have appealed for information."Attacking children, especially those who have lost their homes, is incredibly vile", leading Conservative MP Norbert RÃ¶ttgen wrote on Twitter.The Leipzig Public Prosecutor's Office and the Saxony State Criminal Police Office have been placed in charge of the investigation.

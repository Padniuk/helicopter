"The Russians are running, little by little," he said. "We kick them out."The Ukrainian government says it will not accept a ceasefire until Russian troops withdraw from its territory.And on the frontlines, Ukrainian soldiers told Euronews that they are braced for a long fight.Watch Anelise Borges' exclusive report in the video player above.

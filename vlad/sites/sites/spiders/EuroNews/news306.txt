Oleksii Chernyshov was speaking to Euronews after presenting a report to the European Commission detailing Ukraine's current and future needs.He said that â€œright now we are focussing on our survival needs, the things needed to be prepared for the winter, and we have elaborated the amount of 3.4 billion dollars required for the next four months, that we are discussing now intensively. We will be setting up - and it is already in process - an appropriate trust fund run by the World Bank and it will be operational very soon."You can watch the full interview above.

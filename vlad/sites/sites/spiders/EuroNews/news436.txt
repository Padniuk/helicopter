"New attack on Dnipro airport. Nothing remains of it. The airport itself and nearby infrastructure have been destroyed. And the missiles continue to fly," Governor Valentin Reznichenko wrote on TelegramHowever journalists heard a plane taking off, a sign that the runway was likely not affected by the latest strike. Governor Reznichenko says local authorities are "in the process of determining the number of victims." Dnipro airport had already been hit on March 15 by a Russian bombardment: the governor claimed at that time that the runway had been "destroyed" and the terminal "damaged". Dnipro, an industrial city of one million inhabitants and a majority Russian-speaking population. It has been relatively spared from the fighting between Ukrainian and Russian forces so far. 04.10.202216:36Russia appoints new Ukraine war commanderRussia has appointed a new Ukraine war commander, turning to General Alexander Dvornikov, 60, one of Russia’s most experienced military officers and -- according to American officials -- a general with a record of brutality against civilians in Syria and other war theaters. The senior official who identified the new commander was not authorized to be identified and spoke on condition of anonymity.But the White House national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said in a Sunday television interview that “no appointment of any general can erase the fact that Russia has already faced a strategic failure in Ukraine.”“This general will just be another author of crimes and brutality against Ukrainian civilians,” Sullivan told CNN.The decision to establish new battlefield leadership comes as Russia gears up for what is expected to be a large and more focused push to expand Russian control in the Donbas and follows a failed opening bid to conquer Kyiv.Dvornikov gained prominence while leading the Russian group of forces in Syria, where Moscow has waged a military campaign since 2015 to shore up President Bashar Assad’s regime during a devastating civil war.Dvornikov is a career military officer and has steadily risen through the ranks after starting as a platoon commander in 1982. He fought during the second war in Chechnya and took several top positions before being placed in charge of the Russian troops in Syria in 2015.In 2016, Putin awarded Dvornikov the Hero of Russia medal, one of the country’s highest awards. Dvornikov has served as the commander of the Southern Military District since 2016.(AP) FILE - In this photo taken on March 17, 2016, Russian President Vladimir Putin poses with Col. Gen.

Speaking on Britain's Sky News, Iryna Venediktova says there have also been 5,600 investigations opened into alleged war crimes by Russian forces since the Kremlin launched an invasion of neighbouring Ukraine on 24 February. (AFP)04.10.202215:08 04.10.202214:40Finland returns confiscated art to RussiaFinland says that a shipment of art works from Russian museums has been returned to Russia, after it was seized under European Union sanctions against Moscow.Finland's customs service said late Saturday that the Foreign Ministry granted a special permit to return the consignment with a total insured value of around 42 million euros. It said that trucks carrying the art works from the Hermitage Museum and the Pavlovsk State Museum in St. Petersburg, among others, left Finnish territory on Saturday afternoon.The shipment was seized at the Vaalimaa border crossing at the beginning of April. The works were en route to Russia after loan to museums in Europe and Japan. Experts say that art works loaned from Russia typically travel overland via Finland.Russia has demanded the return of all works on loan to “unfriendly” nations that imposed sanctions following its invasion of Ukraine.(AP)04.10.202214:39More sanctions on the agenda for EU foreign ministers EU foreign ministers will discuss a 6th sanctions package against Moscow on Monday in Luxembourg, but calls to cut off oil and gas purchases, which in part finance Russia's war efforts, has divided the 27 member nations. “We have just imposed heavy sanctions on Russia and we are preparing for a sixth wave,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced on Friday during her visit to Kyiv. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky continues to ask all his European interlocutors "for the adoption of powerful sanctions". He is calling for a halt to oil and gas purchases and the supply of heavy weapons.The EU's de facto foreign minister Josep Borrell announced his intention to launch the discussion on an oil embargo on Monday, "but a formal proposal is not on the table", the senior European official admitted on Friday."Unanimity is necessary for the adoption of sanctions. We can clearly see the dependencies vis-à-vis Russia in several Member States", he underlined.Germany, Italy, Austria and Hungary are very dependent on Russian gas."We are not going to present something that will not pass. Proposals must be made at the appropriate time," he explained. Since the start of the war in Ukraine in late February, the Kremlin has made $27.3 billion from EU oil, gas and coal purchases, according to Velina Tchakarova, director of the Austrian Institute for Europe and the security policy (AIES).The EU has decreed an embargo on the purchases of coal but their amount is much lower than those of gas and oil.(AFP)<template v-if="items" v-for="item in items | orderBy 'rank'"><div class="c-scribblelive__item"  v-bind:class="[{'c-scribblelive__item--pinned': !item.rank}]" v-bind:id="'scrbbl-item-' + item.id" data-scribblelive-id="{{item.id}}"><div class="c-scribblelive__date">

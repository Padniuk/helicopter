Ukraine reports strike on Russian ammunition depot in the southUkrainian authorities said Tuesday that their forces targeted a Russian ammunition depot in southern Ukraine overnight, resulting in a massive explosion captured on social media.The Ukrainian military’s southern command said a rocket strike targeted the depot in Russian-held Nova Kakhovka, about 35 miles (55 kilometers) east of the Black Sea port city of Kherson, which is also occupied by Russian forces.The precision of the strike suggested Ukrainian forces used U.S-supplied multiple-launch High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, to hit the area. Ukraine indicated in recent days that it might launch a counteroffensive to reclaim territory in the country’s south as Russia devotes resources to capturing all of the eastern Donbas region.Russia’s Tass news agency offered a different account of the blast in Nova Kakhovka, saying a mineral fertilizer storage facility exploded, and that a market, hospital and houses were damaged in the strike. Some of the ingredients in fertilizer can be used for ammunition.A satellite photo taken Tuesday and analyzed by The Associated Press showed significant damage. A massive crater stood precisely where a large warehouse-like structure once stood in the city,Ukraine now has eight of the HIMAR systems, a truck-mounted missile launcher with high accuracy, and Washington has promised to send another four.FILE: US troops assist with unloading humanitarian goods in support of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in PolandSgt.

EU and US approve more funds for UkraineUkraine is getting an additional $1.7 billion (€1.7 billion) extra assistance from the US government and the World Bank to pay the salaries of its beleaguered healthcare workers and provide other essential services.The money coming Tuesday from the US Agency for International Development, the Treasury Department and the World Bank is meant to alleviate the acute budget deficit caused by Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “brutal war of aggression,” USAID said in a statement.While many medical staffers have left Ukraine, some hospitals have shut down and other hospitals have been bombed. The health workers who remain in Ukraine do their jobs in dire conditions. Viktor Liashko, Ukraine’s minister of health, said paying health workers' salaries is becoming more difficult each month “due to the overwhelming burden of war."“$1.7 billion is not just yet another financial support; it is an investment that makes us a step closer to victory," Liashko said in a statement.Also on Tuesday European ministers approved a Commission proposal to provide an additional €1 billion in assistance to Ukraine.The new macro-financial assistance (MFA) adds to the €1.2 billion already given earlier this year and will be issued as a long-term loan.It is intended to address the immediate and most urgent funding needs of Ukraine and to ensure the Ukrainian state can continue to perform its most critical functions.Read more at our story here.Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, speaks to Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi in Ashgabat, June 2022Grigory Sysoyev/Sputnik4.

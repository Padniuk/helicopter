Ukraine war is 'a wake-up call' for faster transition to green energy

Western countries must respond to the current energy crisis rocking the world and exacerbated by Russia's war in Ukraine by accelerating their transition toward carbon neutrality and "friend-shoring" their supply chains, top US and EU officials said on Tuesday.US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen opened the Brussels Economic Forum by arguing that the war -- which has resulted in spikes in energy prices and exposed Europe's dependence on Russian fossil fuels -- constitutes a "wake-up call to expedite the global transition to a more secure and cleaner energy future"."No country controls the wind and the sun. Let’s make sure that this is the last time that the global economy is held hostage to the hostile actions of those who produce fossil fuels. This will happen again if we don’t change our approach," she added.As a result of Russia's ongoing attack on its neighbour, the US, EU and UK have imposed multiple rounds of sanctions meant to weaken Moscow's ability to finance and wage its war. State companies, high-ranking officials as well as leading businessmen and oligarchs have been sanctioned while exports of key technology products to Russia have been barred.In retaliation, Moscow has cut gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria.

Europe, for instance, only has one functioning lithium mine and therefore imports nearly all of the lithium it needs to produce batteries that are needed for electric cars and electronics as well as to store energy from renewable sources.China, however, has already heavily invested in rare earth materials such as lithium and now is a world leader in lithium refining and lithium-ion battery production.

Col. Anton Semelroth, said Ukrainian troops are training on the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS, at Grafenwoehr training base in Germany and elsewhere in Europe.The US agreed to send four of the medium-range, precision rocket systems to Ukraine as part of a $700 million (€654) package approved last week, and officials said it would take about three weeks of training before they could go to the battlefront.Russian President Vladimir Putin warned on Sunday that any Western deliveries of longer-range rocket systems would prompt Moscow to hit “objects that we haven’t yet struck.”About 900 Ukrainian service members have received training on a variety of weapons by the U.S. so far, including on howitzers which are being delivered to the front lines.The HIMARS is mounted on a truck and can carry a container with six rockets, which can each travel about 70 kilometres.(AP)06.07.202217:03Stalemate with Russia 'not an option', Zelenskyy saysUkraine will fight to recover all its territory occupied by Russian forces, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Tuesday, as his troops battled street-to-street in Sievierodonetsk in one of the bloodiest land battles of the war."We have already lost too many people to simply cede our territory," he said by video link at an event hosted by Britain's Financial Times newspaper.Stalemate was "not an option", he said.

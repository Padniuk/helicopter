Outrage at pro-Putin chants at Turkey-Ukraine football matchUkrainian officials have expressed their anger at Turkish football fans who chanted at Vladimir Putin's name at a Champions League kick-about in Istanbul.Thousands of Fenerbahce supporters joined in the chant after their team conceded a goal to Ukrainian champions Dynamo Kyiv.Ukrainian Ambassador Vasyl Bodnar said the incident had "saddened" him deeply, with one football journalist branding the chart "absolutely tasteless."Footage of the controversial chant has been viewed more than seven million times on social media.  "We will never understand the words of support for the Russian killer and aggressor who deliberately kills Ukrainians and destroys our country," Bodnar wrote on Facebook. "Even football, which is so loved in Turkey, has its limits."Dynamo Kyiv won the match 2-1, having drawn 0-0 in the first leg played in Poland because of Russia's invasion.Competition organiser Uefa told the BBC that it has opened an investigation into the incident.4. 'Double standards' in treatment of non-Ukrainian refugees, finds expertPoland has been accused of double standards in its treatment of Ukrainian refugees, compared to non-Europeans fleeing conflicts in Africa and the Middle East, by a UN expert. Those affected include permanent residents of Ukraine, “undocumented” migrants and people who had sought asylum in the country before the war forced them to flee again, said Felipe González Morales, United Nations Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants on Thursday."Even for those that have fled the same war, although all were accepted for entry into Poland and have received assistance from the State, third country nationals are not protected under the same legal framework," he said. “This double standard approach has led to feelings of being discriminated."González Morales did commend Poland for hosting some 2 million Ukrainian refugees who have come to the country, granting them permission to work, as well as access to health care, education and other public services.“This explains why I do not see refugee camps in Poland,” he said.Two-thirds of Ukraine refugees plan to stay put for now, according to UNHCREuropol operation targets online trafficking of Ukrainian refugees5. Belarus opposition leader condemns attacks on Ukraine launched from her countryThe Belarusian opposition leader, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, has condemned the latest escalation in the war in Ukraine launched from Belarus.“Horrified to see how Russia continues to use Belarus to attack Ukraine,” she tweeted. “At least 25 missiles were launched from Belarus targeting Kyiv, Chernihiv and other cities this morning. Lukashenka can’t fool anyone. He is guilty of crimes against Belarusians and Ukrainians and must be held accountable.”6. Ukraine claims ship carrying stolen barley reaches LebanonA Syrian cargo ship, sanctioned by the US and carrying what Kyiv says is stolen barley from the war-torn country, has docked in Lebanon, the Ukrainian diplomatic mission in the Middle Eastern nation said Thursday.According to the Ukrainian Embassy in Beirut, the cargo vessel Laodicea docked in the port of Tripoli, Lebanon’s second-largest city. It was carrying 5,000 tonnes of flour and 5,000 tonnes of barley, the embassy said.The US Department of the Treasury sanctioned the Laodicea in 2015 for its affiliation with the Syrian government of President Bashar Assad.Ukraine has accused Russia of plundering grain and steel from its territory since Moscow invaded the country in late February. The embassy in Beirut did not elaborate or say how the barley was purportedly stolen from Ukraine.Marine Traffic, which monitors vessel traffic and the location of ships on seas, also confirmed the ships docking in Tripoli on Thursday. The Laodicea was initially heading to Tartus Port in Syria and was expected to arrive there earlier this week.It was unknown why it had rerouted to Lebanon and whether or not it was offloading the cargo here.

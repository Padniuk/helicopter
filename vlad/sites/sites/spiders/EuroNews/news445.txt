It’s up to the Russian people,” Blinken said.President Macron distances himself from Biden's commentsFrench President Emmanuel Macron distanced himself from Biden's comments on Sunday. In an interview with France-3 television, Macron said “we should be factual and [...] do everything so that the situation doesn’t get out of control.”Macron said: “I wouldn’t use those terms, because I continue to speak to President Putin, because what we want to do collectively is that we want to stop the war Russia launched in Ukraine, without waging war and without an escalation.”  President Macron has spoken several times with Vladimir Putin before and during the conflict in an attempt at peacemaking. He is due to speak to the Russian president again either on Sunday or Monday. Macron stressed that the US remains an important ally, saying, “We share many common values, but those who live next to Russia are the Europeans.”

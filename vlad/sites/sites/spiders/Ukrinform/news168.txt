The death toll in Russia’s missile attack on a convoy of civilian cars, leaving the city of Zaporizhzhia, increased to 31, as another woman died at hospital.

The relevant statement was made by Zaporizhzhia Regional Military Administration Head Oleksandr Starukh during a nationwide telethon, an Ukrinform correspondent reports. “Unfortunately, the number of victims has increased. Another woman, who had been seriously injured, died. Now the death toll rose to 31: thirty civilians and one police officer who was helping people,” Starukh told. In his words, Russian troops attacked the convoy in three places: at the head, in the middle and at the end. No one could have predicted this. “Yet another example that we are dealing with the terrorist state,” Starukh added. According to Starukh, at a meeting of the Defense Council, the Ukrainian side made a decision to close a checkpoint for several days. Those who used to go to the temporarily occupied areas through that checkpoint were mostly volunteers and people who visited their elderly relatives. A reminder that, on September 30, 2022, Russian troops struck a convoy of civilian cars, leaving the city of Zaporizhzhia, with the S-300 missiles. mk

The Ukrainian State Border Guard Service has not recorded provocations at the border with the Republic of Belarus so far, but special attention is being given to this direction.

The relevant statement was made by Spokesperson for the Ukrainian State Border Guard Service Andrii Demchenko during a nationwide telethon, an Ukrinform correspondent reports. “At the moment, fortunately, the situation is stable. Our country’s security and defense forces are keeping control of the border line, border areas, and are doing whatever is necessary to strengthen this direction, as we clearly understand Belarus is providing support for Russia in the war against our country,” Demchenko told. In his words, Ukrainian forces have never ruled out and do not rule out that Belarusian units may decide to enter the territory of Ukraine or create provocations. “Therefore, all the defense forces – the Border Guard Service, the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the National Guard – are in place in this direction in order to handle the situation, prevent provocations and, moreover, invasion,” Demchenko stressed. A reminder that, according to the mass media, Russia’s Liga mercenaries have arrived in Minsk to prepare provocations at the Ukrainian border. mk

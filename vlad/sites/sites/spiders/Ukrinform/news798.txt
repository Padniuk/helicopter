Russia is preparing massive cyberattacks on the critical infrastructure of Ukraine and its allies.

According to Ukrinform, the Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraineâ€™s Ministry of Defense   this in a Facebook post. "The Kremlin is planning to carry out massive cyberattacks on the critical infrastructure facilities of Ukrainian enterprises and critical infrastructure institutions of Ukraine's allies. Attacks will be aimed at energy sector enterprises. The experience of cyberattacks on Ukraine's energy systems in 2015 and 2016 will be used when conducting operations," the report reads. According to the Main Intelligence Directorate, with cyberattacks, the enemy will try to increase the effect of missile strikes on electricity supply facilities, primarily in the east and south of Ukraine. The command of the Russian Federation is convinced that this will slow down the offensive operations of the Ukrainian Defense Forces. The Kremlin also intends to increase DDoS attacks on the critical infrastructure of Ukraine's closest allies, primarily Poland and the Baltic states. As Ukrinform reported, at the end of August, the State Service for Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine announced that within six months since the start of the full-scale invasion, enemy hackers had attacked Ukraine 1,123 times. iy

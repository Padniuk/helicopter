Russian invaders struck a civilian infrastructure object in the center of Kryvyi Rih, employing a kamikaze drone.

That’s according to Oleksandr  , head of the Kryvyi Rih Military Administration, who broke the news on Telegram, urging residents not to post any images from the scene of the strike, Ukrinform reports. "A kamikaze drone attack on a civil infrastructure object in one of the city’s central districts. Don’t post or upload anything on social media. The emergency response effort is underway," Vilkul wrote. As Ukrinform reported earlier, Russian troops shelled communities of the Nikopol district in Dnipropetrovsk region three times over the past day.

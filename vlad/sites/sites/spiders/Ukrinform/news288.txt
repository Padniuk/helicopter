A new enemy offensive from the territory of Belarus cannot be ruled out, as Russia is posed to send mobilized military units there. Some units have already been deployed on the Belarusian territory and are now refurbishing mothballed airfields built back in Soviet times.

That’s according to Security Service Colonel Roman Kostenko, who now serves as Secretary of the Verkhovna Rada Committee on National Security, Defense and Intelligence, who spoke in an  with Ukrinform. He emphasized that Ukraine considers Belarus to be its enemy, therefore it maintains defenses along the entire common borderline. "I have information that Russia will send its military units into Belarus. Some units are already stationed there. They are reviving the mothballed airfields built during the Soviet era. Newly mobilized units of fighters will also be deployed there. This is a threat. It cannot be ruled out that from there, they will make another push – in the north," Kostenko noted. In his opinion, Belarus will enter the war against Ukraine if Russia starts making serious gains. "We take all this into account. We know that Belarus is an enemy. We are aware that they can join the war. However, we are doing everything to make sure nothing works out for them," Kostenko stressed. As reported earlier, the self-proclaimed president of the Republic of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, confirmed that his country is indeed participating in the Russo-Ukrainian war in Ukraine, stopping short of sending its troops. Therefore, Belarus “doesn’t kill anyone,” he claimed. Belarus has been providing material and technical support to the Russian Federation in the ongoing war, in particular, at the beginning of the invasion, part of the Russian troops crossed into Ukraine through the Belarusian border. In addition, it is from the territory of Belarus, that the Russian air force flies sorties to bombard Ukrainian cities, as well as launch missiles across the territory of Ukraine.

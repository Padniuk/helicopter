The command of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet has almost certainly relocated its KILO-class submarines from the port of Sevastopol in the temporarily occupied Crimea to Novorossiysk, southern Russia.

According to Ukrinform, the UK Ministry of Defense said this in its latest   published on Twitter. “The command of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet has almost certainly relocated its KILO-class submarines from their home port of Sevastopol in Crimea to Novorossiysk in Krasnodar Krai, southern Russia. This is highly likely due to the recent change in the local security threat level in the face of increased Ukrainian long-range strike capability. In the last two months, the fleet headquarters (in Sevastopol – ed.) and its main naval aviation airfield (in Saky – ed.) have been attacked,” the report reads. It is noted that guaranteeing the Black Sea Fleet’s Crimea basing was likely one of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s motivations for annexing the peninsula in 2014. “Base security has now been directly undermined by Russia’s continued aggression against Ukraine,” the report reads. iy

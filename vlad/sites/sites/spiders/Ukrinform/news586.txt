Fifty-two more bodies have been exhumed near the Kharkiv region’s Izium, and many of them bear signs of a violent death, such as broken ribs, fractured skulls, etc.

The relevant statement was made by Ukrainian Internal Affairs Deputy Minister Yevhenii Yenin during a nationwide telethon, an Ukrinform correspondent reports. “More than 1,000 police officers are involved in the implementation of measures intended to restore public order and safety within the Kharkiv region’s liberated settlements. Over the past day, we have established control over 12 settlements, and mopping-up operations are underway. Since the de-occupation efforts started, we have established control and carried out mopping-up operations within 118 settlements with about 50,000 local residents,” Yenin told. Additionally, Yenin told about the bodies exhumed near the Kharkiv region’s Izium. A total of 168 bodies have already been recovered (about 50 over the past day), including those of the Ukrainian servicemen. “Exhumation procedures at the mass burial site continue. Fifty-two bodies have been exhumed, including those of children. We continue to find the bodies bearing signs of a violent death, and there are quite many of them. These are broken ribs and fractured skulls, men with their hands tied, jaws broken, genital organs cut off,” Yenin noted. Yenin stressed that the blood of these Ukrainians is in the hands of Russians and their leader. A reminder that, on September 10, 2022, the Armed Forces of Ukraine liberated the Kharkiv region’s Izium from Russian invaders. The city had been under Russian occupation since early April 2022. mk

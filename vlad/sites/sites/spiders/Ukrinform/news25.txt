The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has increased its presence in Ukraine and has staff deployed in six locations across the country.

Matilda Bogner, the head of the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, said this on Tuesday, September 27, while presenting a new report of the UN Human Rights Office on Ukraine, according to an Ukrinform correspondent. "Since the publication of our last report at the end of June, OHCHR has increased its presence in the country. We currently have staff deployed in six locations throughout the country. Every day we speak to people and hear from victims who have suffered human rights violations in the context of the armed conflict, which escalated following the armed attack of the Russian Federation," she said. Bogner said that civilians continue to bear the brunt of the hostilities. "As of this week, we have documented that 5,996 people who have been killed and 8,848 injured. Those killed included 382 children. These figures represent verified individual incidents, and the actual figures are considerably higher," she said. Bogner noted that attacks impacting civilian objects not only endanger the lives of civilians, but also left them living in degrading conditions and undermining their rights to health, education, housing, food and water. "Intense shelling also negatively impacted freedom of religion or belief, with many buildings of worship destroyed and damaged. To date, we have recorded damage or destruction to 252 medical facilities and 415 educational facilities across the country, but the actual numbers are higher," she said.

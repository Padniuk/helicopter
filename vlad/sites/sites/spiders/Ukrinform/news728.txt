The former President of Mongolia, Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, has called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to immediately stop the war against Ukraine, adding that Mongolia is ready to receive Russians fleeing a military mobilization announced by Putin's regime.

According to Ukrinform, the World Mongol Federation shared his message on  . "I have a simple message to President Putin. Stop the war! I have met with you on many occasions. You have the power to stop this war right now. Now it's time to make peace. My heart is breaking apart when I see Russia. Since you started this war Russia has been drowned in fears, full of tears. Your mobilization brings oceans of suffering. Mr. President, stop your senseless killings and destruction!" Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj said. He noted that since the beginning of the bloody war against Ukraine, ethnic minorities in Russia have suffered the most, in particular, residents of Buryatia, Tuva, and Kalmykia, whom the Kremlin uses as cannon fodder. That is why Mongolia is ready to accept people fleeing Putin's mobilization. Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj separately addressed those being forced to fight Putin's war in Ukraine. "Don't shoot Ukrainians. Don't shoot your sisters and brothers, children and elders. Do not kill that country. Do not kill their freedom. Ukraine has a full right to exist," he said. He also conveyed a message to the brave people of Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelensky. "Thank you for your bravery and leadership. The best side of the world is with you. You are an inspiration. When you win, all people will win. No dictatorship lasts forever. The united will of people's freedom will always prevail. Slava Heroyam [Glory to the Heroes]!" Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj said.

The Armed Forces of Ukraine sank an enemy barge with military equipment and occupants on board at the southern front.

As the Operational Command "South"  , the Russians tried to transport their weapons with the help of that vessel. According to the Command, the Armed Forces of Ukraine exercised fire control of transport routes, logistics centers, maneuvers and redeployment, basing points, and control posts of enemy units. In general, the situation at the southern front is steadily tense, but controlled by the Defense Forces. "The invaders retreat from positions, losing a tactically advantageous location. However, they do not stop trying to test the strength of our units," the military said. Thus, the enemy once again carried out assault operations with forces up to a platoon, supported by two T-72 tanks and other armored vehicles, but were unsuccessful. They lost two airborne vehicles and a third of their manpower and retreated. The Operational Command "South" also noted that the Ukrainian artillery gunners disrupted the plans of the occupiers to restore the Antonivka railway bridge. Over the past day, the enemy actively conducted aerial reconnaissance, opened rocket and artillery fire, and launched 12 airstrikes on Ukrainian positions and territorial communities along the front line. At the same time, the Ukrainian aviation launched three strikes on the enemy and destroyed two Russian reconnaissance drones of the operational-tactical level, while the missile and artillery units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine performed more than 320 fire missions over the past day. In total, the Ukrainian military eliminated 62 occupiers and five armored vehicles in the south over the past day. ol

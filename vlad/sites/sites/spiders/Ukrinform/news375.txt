Russian invaders have completely disconnected the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.

Ukraineâ€™s state-owned energy company   announced this on Telegram, Ukrinform reports. "Tonight, at 00:59, due to another shelling by Russian troops, the last power line connecting [ZNPP] with energy system - 750 kW ZNPP Dnipovska - was damaged and disconnected from power system. As a result, the Zaporizhzhia NPP was completely disconnected. The diesel generators were switched on automatically," the report reads. Energoatom says that the available diesel fuel reserves will be enough for their operation in such mode for 10 days, therefore, repair and restoration of the ZNPP power lines with the energy network is required. As reported, Russian troops seized the territory of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in March. On October 5, the Kremlin officially announced that the power plant now allegedly belongs to Russia. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said during his visit to Kyiv on Thursday that the temporarily occupied nuclear power plant in Enerhodar remains Ukrainian. iy

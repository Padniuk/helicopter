Traffic on the Crimean Bridge stopped completely, huge queues at petrol stations on the peninsula have formed.

As the Krymsky Viter (Crimean Wind)  channel reports, the "Crimean Railways" announced the suspension of train operations and train delays. Traffic on the road section of the bridge has also been completely stopped. The occupation authorities say that they plan to launch a ferry crossing. Meanwhile, huge queues have formed at petrol stations in Sevastopol, Simferopol and other cities of the peninsula. As noted, Crimeans understand that the ferry crossing will not work in the near future, and there are no large fuel stocks on the peninsula. As reported, a fire broke out on the Crimean Bridge, which connects Russia and the temporarily occupied Ukrainian Crimea. Fuel tanks are on fire and part of the roadway is destroyed. ol

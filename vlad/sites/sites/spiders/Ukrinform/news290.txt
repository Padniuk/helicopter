Russian objects on Ukrainian territory temporarily seized by the Russians are legitimate targets for attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, while de-occupation of Ukrainian lands is part of a defensive war.

This was stated by the adviser to the head of the President’s Office, Mykhailo  , via Twitter, Ukrinform reports. "Any Russian objects on occupied territories – legitimate military targets for attack by Ukraine’s Armed Forces. Any counteroffensive and de-occupation of territories falls under the concept of defensive war. This is an absolute axiom for both the leadership of Ukraine and our allies," emphasized Podolyak. As Ukrinform reported earlier, the Russian military death toll in Ukraine since the full-scale invasion is estimated at nearly 61,000. Ukraine’s forces destroyed 2,435 enemy main battle tanks, 5,038 armored combat vehicles, 1,414 artillery systems, and scores of other military equipment.

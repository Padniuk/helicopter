The Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine states that the decree of President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin to incorporate the temporarily occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant “as federal property” has no legal force.

This is said in a   of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Ukrinform reports. “The long list of crimes and gross violations of international law by Russia since the beginning of its full-scale aggression against Ukraine has been supplemented by another crime today - an illegal attempt to take control over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. We consider the relevant decree issued by the President of the Russian Federation on this issue to be null and void," the ministry said. The Ukrainian foreign diplomatic service strongly condemns this crime, which further increases the risks and threats in the field of nuclear security caused by the Russian occupation of ZNPP, and called on all states to adhere to a consistent position in ensuring binding political, economic and legal consequences in relation to the terrorist state for all its criminal and illegal actions. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs proposes that the European Union, the G7 countries and other partners urgently consider the introduction of sanctions against the Russian state corporation Rosatom, its affiliated companies and institutions, as well as other key representatives of Russia's nuclear energy industry. On October 5, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree instructing the government of the Russian Federation to "ensure that the facilities for the use of nuclear energy of the Zaporizhzhia NPP are taken into federal ownership”. iy

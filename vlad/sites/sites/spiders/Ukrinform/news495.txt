The actions of the Russians in Ukraine show that Russia is again committing the most heinous crimes, as it was in the past.

Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said this on  , Ukrinform reports. "83 years since the criminal Soviet attack on Poland and 82 years since the Katyn massacre and we know one thing: Russia has returned to its most gruesome past," Morawiecki wrote, responding to reports of Russian crimes in Izium, Kharkiv region. Poland's Deputy Foreign Minister, Pawel Jablonski, in turn,  that it is impossible not to compare this horror to Katyn. "The worst thing is that there are probably dozens of such places on Ukrainian lands still occupied by the Russians," Jablonski said. He added that everyone is now "witnessing the largest crime against civilians in Europe since World War II." Jablonski said continued and increased military aid for Ukraine is a "duty" in order for Russia to be defeated and for criminals to be brought to justice, including "direct executors, commanders, and the main organizers, led by Putin." The Ukrainian Interior Ministry believes the number of Ukrainian citizens who died because of the actions of the Russian forces in the Kharkiv region could be significantly higher than that in Bucha. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said on September 16 it wanted to send a team to Izium to verify a mass burial site where more than 400 graves had been found after Ukrainian forces recaptured the city from Russian invaders.

Russia must immediately withdraw its forces from the territory of Ukraine, while fake referendum held in the temporarily captured areas are “illegal.”

The Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ann Linde, spoke on the issue in an address to the UN General Assembly, an Ukrinform correspondent reports. "The war in Ukraine must stop, and Russia’s troops withdraw. The fake ‘referendum’ on Ukrainian territory would be illegal and will have no effect," the foreign minister said. She also emphasized that neither partial mobilization, nor "nuclear sabre rattling, nor any other escalation will deter us from supporting Ukraine." The chief of Sweden’s diplomacy emphasized that Ukraine's nuclear power plants must be protected from Russia’s “illegal and reckless” attacks. Accountability for the “heinous crimes” committed must be ensured, the minister stressed, adding that it is necessary that international law be upheld. According to her, Russia's aggression against Ukraine has caused the greatest refugee crisis in Europe since the Second World War, aggravating the already serious refugee situation globally. Because of the actions of one country, many people suffer from hunger and poverty, she noted. Linde also emphasized the fact that the Russian invasion of Ukraine is a violation of international law that is “to protect us all from aggression.” Sweden followed Finland in applying to join NATO - the decision “anchored in a firm belief that security is best built together with others.” As reported, on February 24, Russia kicked off a new stage of its war against Ukraine – a full-scale invasion. Russian troops have been shelling and bombing peaceful cities and villages, killing the civilian population and destroying infrastructure. Ukraine’s defense forces have stood up to repel the Russian onslaught.

The European Union is shocked by and condemns the atrocities by Russian forces, exposed in the recently liberated territories of Ukraine in Khariv region, including the town of Izium.

That’s according to a statement by EU High Representative Josep  , the EU External Action press service reports. “The European Union is deeply shocked by mass graves discovered by Ukrainian authorities with more than 440 bodies in Izyum, a city recently liberated from invading Russian military. We condemn these atrocities in the strongest possible terms,” the statement says. As noted by the EU top diplomat, Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine “has been leaving a trail of blood and destruction across Ukraine.” “Thousands of civilians have been already murdered, many more tortured, harassed, sexually assaulted, kidnapped, or forcibly displaced,” Borrell recalled, noting that this “inhuman behaviour by the Russian forces, in total disregard of international humanitarian law and the Geneva conventions, must stop immediately.” “Russia, its political leadership, and all those involved in the ongoing violations of international law and international humanitarian law in Ukraine will be held accountable. The EU supports every effort in this regard,” said the High Representative. As Ukrinform reported earlier, more than 400 graves with bodies of civilians and military were discovered in the liberated part of Kharkiv region.

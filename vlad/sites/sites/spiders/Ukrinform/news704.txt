Instead, on September 21, the defense ministers of Germany and Slovenia agreed on a "ring exchange", according to which Slovenia is expected to supply Ukraine with 28 M-55S main battle tanks of the Soviet design in exchange for modern German military trucks from Bunderswehr stocks. Similar schemes already operate with the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Greece. Germany is currently the largest arms supplier to Ukraine in the EU and the third in the world after the USA and Great Britain. As of September 19, Germany has sent to Ukraine weapons and equipment worth over EUR 733,634,486.

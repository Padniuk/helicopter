Russian forces may be preparing to forcibly mobilize Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) to fight for Russia, which would constitute a violation of the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War.

The relevant  was made by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), an Ukrinform correspondent reports. According to the ISW, continued reports of military commissars conducting chaotic distribution of mobilization summonses indicate that they feel significant pressure to carry out mobilization as quickly as possible, which is not reflected in Shoiguâ€™s statements. Positions held by senior Russian military leadership are continuing to change hands, suggesting that Putin is continuing to see systemic problems as the result of the personal failings of senior subordinates. Ukrainian forces likely continued to make gains along the Kharkiv-Luhansk region border and northwest of Lyman, the ISW noted. mk

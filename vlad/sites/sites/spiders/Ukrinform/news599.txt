The invaders illegally took 135 children from Donetsk region to Moscow by plane of the Ministry of Defense of Russia, intending to resettle them in Russian families.

"Russia continues to steal children from Mariupol and Donetsk region. 135 children were taken to Moscow by the Russian Defense Ministry plane. It is definitely known about one three-year-old girl from Mariupol at least," Petro Andriushchenko, adviser to Mariupol mayor, posted on  . According to him, the children are immediately given Russian citizenship. The Russians plan to resettle the Ukrainian children among Russian families in Astrakhan, Voronezh, Kursk, Moscow, Murmansk and other regions. "Currently, the children are held in a camp near Moscow. Russian children's commissioner Lvova-Belova continues to guide the program of abduction of Ukrainian children," the mayor's adviser noted. As reported, as of September 1, according to intelligence data, the invaders took 2,161 children with the status of deprived of parental care from Ukraine. Fifty-five children were returned. It is very difficult to calculate how many children have been taken from their families. ol

The Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has confirmed the Russian military are using Iranian-manufactured drones in the war against Ukraine, such as Shahed-136 and other modifications.

The relevant statement was made by Spokesperson for the Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Yurii Ihnat during a nationwide telethon, an Ukrinform correspondent reports. “As for Iran, indeed, there is information that the Russian army is receiving and already using [Iranian drones – Ed.]. We have already seen one unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) shot down, Shahed-136. It is a loitering munition, actually a suicide drone. It is clear that this target is extremely difficult, and we need additional systems to shoot such targets down,” Ihnat told. In his words, Russia is likely to use other Iranian-manufactured drone modifications in the war against Ukraine, and the Ukrainian side should be ready for this. “These are the new challenges, and there will be an adequate response and the new methods of countering them,” Ihnat noted. Ihnat expressed hope that, in response to the supply of such arms for Russia from Iran and other authoritarian countries, the democratic world would provide advanced weapons to Ukraine. A reminder that the Ukrainian military were likely to have destroyed an Iranian-manufactured unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) near Kupiansk on September 13, 2022. mk

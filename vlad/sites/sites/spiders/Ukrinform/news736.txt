Ukrainian technical staff work as hostages at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, as there are half a thousand Russian fighters with military equipment stationed there.

"Russia seized this [Zaporizhzhia] nuclear power plant. Ukrainian technical staff are there now but they are like hostages because there are 500 [Russian] fighters and equipment [stationed at ZNPP]. This has already been confirmed by the IAEA," President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky  French media in an interview. The Head of State noted that the ZNPP is currently disconnected from the power grid and the staff struggle to turn on at least one unit out of six. He emphasized that Russia was not interested in the operation of the plant. According to the President, the Russians want the ZNPP not to supply electricity primarily to Ukrainian regions, as well as to Europe. Zelensky also emphasized the risk of a nuclear explosion at the plant due to the actions of the Russians, recalling that one unit exploded at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant, while the ZNPP has six units in total. As reported, the Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, has been seized by the Russian military since March 4. Since then, the invaders have placed military equipment and ammunition in the plantâ€™s territory, shelling the surrounding area and the plant itself, destroying power lines, causing the shutdown of power units. ol

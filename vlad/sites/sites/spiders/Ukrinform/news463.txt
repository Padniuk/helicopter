In the center of Luhansk, an explosion rang out in the building of the so-called “Prosecutor General's Office” of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic, as a result of which the "prosecutor general" was injured.

Propaganda media, referring to the Russian invaders, report that unknown people carried an explosive device into the building, according to Ukrinform. The information about the explosion was partially confirmed by the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration, Serhii Haidai, in a conversation with an Ukrinform correspondent. "So far, I don't know whether the ‘prosecutor general’ was injured or killed, who carried the explosive, our partisans or someone else. But I confirm the very fact of the explosion," Haidai said. The fact that someone in the so-called "Prosecutor General's Office of the Luhansk People's Republic" was injured is evidenced by a video footage from the scene of the incident, which was shared on social networks. iy

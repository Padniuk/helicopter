The Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine destroyed six enemy aircraft and two UAVs over the past three days.

Spokesperson for the Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Yurii Ihnat said this during a nationwide telethon, an Ukrinform correspondent reports. "We manage to control the sky quite well. Another enemy UAV was destroyed yesterday, as well as a Ka-52 helicopter of the occupiers in the evening," Ihnat informed. He recalled that four Su-25 and Su-24 aircraft were destroyed the day before and an unmanned aerial vehicle earlier. The spokesman also noted that the enemy has recently started to use more Su-24 aircraft. At the same time, the spokesman emphasized, the Ukrainian Air Force is effectively performing its duties, destroying the enemy. "Since September 13 – a total of 6 planes, 2 UAVs, so the control of the sky for aerial targets, as you can see, is effective," Ihnat said. At the same time, he noted that now attention is focused more on missile terrorism from the side of the Russian Federation. “Unfortunately, we cannot down all missiles, but we expect weapons that will strengthen our air defense system - these are modern western weapons. To date, the air defense forces have received only portable short-range air defense systems, which today strengthen air defense. We try to do the rest ourselves," the spokesman said. As Ukrinform reported, from February 24 to September 16, the Armed Forces of Ukraine eliminated about 54,050 Russian invaders, including 200 over the past day alone. iy

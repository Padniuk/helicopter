"It is with great regret that I have to inform you that the number of victims of the terrorist attack on the city center has increased. Seven residents of the regional center have been confirmed dead, and at least five more people are considered missing. Currently, the dismantling of the rubble is ongoing, and after that it will be possible to establish the exact number of dead and injured," he said. He added that thanks to the prompt work of special services, rescuers and doctors, it was possible to save 21 people, who were already given the necessary assistance. The city authorities placed victims of the shelling in temporary accommodation centers. Starukh emphasized that the shelling of Zaporizhzhia with S-300 missiles is a real terrorist attack, because it was not an accidental hit, but a series of missiles fired at apartment buildings. There are no military or important facilities near the impact site, but only civilian buildings and apartment buildings. During previous shelling instances, the target of the occupiers was mostly civilian infrastructure. On October 6, at 05:00, the enemy struck Zaporizhzhia with S-300 missiles.

This week the Russian military have fired five Kh-22 cruise missiles at Ukraine’s civil infrastructure, and 10 Kh-59 and Kh-31 guided air-launched missiles at urban infrastructure.

The relevant statement was made by Deputy Chief of the Main Operations Directorate at the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Oleksii Hromov at a briefing, an Ukrinform correspondent reports. According to Hromov, as an alternative option, the enemy uses cheap Iranian-manufactured suicide drones, Shahed-136. Russians launch them mainly from the temporarily occupied Crimea. Hromov noted the intensity of the use of such drones had significantly increased compared to last week. “Last week the enemy used two unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs). This week the Iranian-manufactured suicide drones have been used 29 times, and 10 of them have been destroyed by the Ukrainian anti-aircraft defense units,” Hromov told. In general, the air defense and missile units of Ukraine’s Ground Forces destroyed 23 air targets. Today, in the Sumy direction, an enemy Orlan UAV has been shot down with small arms. mk

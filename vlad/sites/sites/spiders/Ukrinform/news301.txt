The Armed Forces of Ukraine have begun to liberate the occupied settlements of Luhansk region: six small settlements have been liberated as of now, but there may be more by the morning.

Serhiy Haidai, the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration,   this on Telegram, Ukrinform reports. The regional authorities do not name the settlements, as they are immediately shelled by Russian troops. "As soon as we indicate certain names [of settlements], the Russian occupying forces, in some powerless anger, start shelling these villages and small towns more often. Even the remains of the existing infrastructure are being destroyed. In general, the direction is clear. After the liberation of Lyman, it was the turn of Luhansk region as well," Haidai said. He assumed that the names of liberated settlements could be announced tomorrow morning, October 6. As of now, it is known about the liberation of six small settlements, but "there may be more of them by the morning", said Haidai. iy

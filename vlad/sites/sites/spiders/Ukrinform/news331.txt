Europe can remain in radiation safety only if 500 Russian militants leave the territory of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.

That's according to the   of the President's Office, which reported on the results of a meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and IAEA Director Rafael Grossi. "So far, the main issue regarding the presence of militants at the ZNPP has not been resolved. According to our data confirmed by our workers, there are about 500 of them. What should be done with them?" Zelensky said. At the same time, he said the Ukrainian side and society expect the IAEA to react to the Russian government's attempt to take over the Ukrainian nuclear power plant. "I will say that this is an unprecedented case that the president of the Russian Federation signed a decree obliging him to transfer the ZNPP into federal ownership. We were waiting for a tough IAEA statement on this. Society is waiting for this condemnation. In my personal opinion, this is a raider attack," he said. Grossi, in turn, said that the Russian president's decision to transfer the Zaporizhzhia NPP to Russian ownership is a violation of international law. During the meeting, Zelensky thanked Grossi for assistance in returning Ihor Murashov, the head of the ZNPP, who was kidnapped by the Russian military. On October 5, Vladimir Putin signed a decree according to which the Zaporizhia nuclear power plant captured by the occupiers will be handed over to Russia.

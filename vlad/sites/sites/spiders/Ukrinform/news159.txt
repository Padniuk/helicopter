Ukrainians are fighting for what is true for any people on the planet – for life and freedom, for the right to happiness for all families and children.

President Volodymyr  of Ukraine wrote about this on Facebook, Ukrinform reports. "Ukraine will continue defending itself and will win in this war waged against us. Because we are on our land. The truth is on our side. And the whole civilized world is with us. We fight for what is true for any people on the planet – for life and freedom, for the right to happiness for all our families, all our children," Zelensky wrote. As reported by Ukrinform, on Friday the Kremlin held a ceremony of "admission into Russia" of the puppet entities "DPR" and "LPR", as well as the territories of Kherson and Zaporizhia regions of Ukraine seized by the Russian army, which sparked widespread international outrage.

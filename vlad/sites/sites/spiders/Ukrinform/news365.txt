Virtually every city or village liberated from Russian invaders had a torture chamber set up in the area, in one form or another.

That’s according to First Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs Yevhen Yenin, who spoke on the air of the national telethon, an Ukrinform correspondent reports. "In fact, every city or village freed from the occupiers had a torture chamber in one form or another. Recently, we coordinated the efforts of law enforcers in the liberated cities, and these torture chambers were being discovered there, one by one – in Velykyi Burluk, Kozacha Lopan, Vovchansk, and Balakleia…" he said. Yenin added that the Russians would often set up these notorious chambers within police stations, where they would keep detainees in terrible conditions, torturing and humiliating them. This list of places where people were deprived of liberty was recently supplemented by a recreational center outside the village of Novoplatonivk in the Izium community. According to the official, a 3-4 meter-deep pit was discovered on the premises, which the Russian military used as a location for torturing and executing detainees. Investigators and experts found on the spot two male bodies, presumably of local residents, handcuffed to each other. Bars were also discovered, which were probably used as a disguise - they were covered with leaves or grass so that the torture chamber was not too visible from the ground level. Near the chamber, another corpse was discovered, believed to be of a local resident, former fighter in the Anti-Terrorist Operation. The body has traces of torture on it, it was stressed. Yenin added that the police have already registered more than 1,100 war crimes committed by the Russian troops in Kharkiv region, which has recently been liberated. As reported, in Kharkiv region, law enforcement officers discovered and inspected 22 torture chambers set up by the invaders.

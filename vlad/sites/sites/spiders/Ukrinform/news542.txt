The number of conflict situations between representatives of the Russian army and those "mobilized from the territory of the ‘LPR’ and ‘DPR’” is increasing. "Volunteers" are being refused medical treatment in hospitals and even left behind in their positions by the retreating units.

That’s according to the  of Ukraine’s Defense Ministry, Ukrinform reports One of the battalions of the so-called "Union of Donbas Volunteers" suffered heavy losses in firefights near Avdiivka. As the wounded servicemen were brought to a hospital in Russia’s Rostov-on-Don, its staff refused to provide medical aid to them citing the fact that the unit is not formally part of Russia’s regular army. The "Union of Donbas Volunteers" was formed under the program of voluntary mobilization of Russia’s combat army reserve. In all such cases where the wounded are refused hospital treatment, medics cite direct instructions by their command. Also, tension is brewing between Russian army servicemen and those mobilized into the invasion force from among the residents of Russian puppet pseudo-republics “LPR” and “DPR.” The conflict is caused by Russian units leaving the latter behind during the retreat, with no support. Due to this, some of the units composed of the “DPR-LPR” draftees have been totally destroyed. The occupation forces are actively discussing the latest losses suffered during a massive withdrawal of Russian troops from Kharkiv region. More than 200 units of heavy military equipment were abandoned in the area, including T-72B3M, T-80BVM, and T-80UE main battle tanks, BMP-2 infantry fighting vehicles, self-propelled guns, and trucks. At the same time, it is noted that the largest amount of equipment was left behind in the Balaklia district at a repair base earlier set up in the area.

Over the past day, the Ukrainian troops repelled Russian attacks near Soledar, Bakhmutske, Yakovlivka, Odradivka, Zaytseve, Bakhmut, Krasnohorivka, Pobeda, Vodiane, and Liubomyrivka settlements.

This is stated in the report of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine as of 18:00, October 6, published on  . As noted, the troops of the Russian Federation try to hold the temporarily captured territories of Ukraine, focusing their efforts on attempts to disrupt the activity of the Ukrainian troops in certain areas and continuing offensive operations in Bakhmut and Avdiivka areas. In some directions, the enemy regroups its units and reinforces defense. It also fires on the Ukrainian positions along the contact line and conducts aerial reconnaissance. At the same time, the aggressors continue to attack civilian infrastructure and residential areas, violating the norms of international humanitarian law, the laws and customs of warfare. There is still a threat of airstrikes and missile strikes on the entire territory of Ukraine. Today, the Russian troops launched six missile strikes and seven airstrikes, more than 23 MLRS attacks. Objects and civilians in more than 25 settlements, including Zaporizhzhia, Shepetivka, Siversk, Bilohorivka, Olhivske, and Hoptivka, were affected by enemy shelling. In Volyn and Polissia directions, the situation has not changed significantly. The enemy opened fire in other directions. In particular, in Siversky direction, Russian troops shelled the areas of Senkivka, Yasna Poliana, and Bleshnia of Chernihiv region, and Seredyna Buda, Kyyanytsia, and Fotovyzh of Sumy region with tube artillery.

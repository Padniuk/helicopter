In New York, Minister for Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba discussed the issue of support for Ukraine with Republican Jim Risch, who chaired the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in 2019-2021.

In a commentary to Ukrinform, Kuleba noted that he thanked Risch for the support for Ukraine from the side of the Congress. The interlocutors discussed the next steps that the Congress plans to take, including after the elections that are scheduled for November. According to Kuleba, they also "talked frankly about the supply of weapons." The minister emphasized that Ukraine is grateful to the United States for the military assistance provided. However, he noted that the need remains and without the support of Congress, Ukraine won't be able to get these weapons. In his Twitter  , Kuleba wrote that during the meeting, he focused on ways of strengthening Ukraine’s air defense capabilities “to better protect Ukrainian cities and towns from Russia’s devastating missile attacks”. He also stressed the importance of designating Russia state sponsor of terrorism. As reported by Ukrinform, the 77th session of the UN General Assembly opened on September 13.

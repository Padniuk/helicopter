Danish Foreign Affairs Minister Jeppe Kofod has announced the creation of a Danish-led project to investigate and document Russian war crimes in Ukraine.

The relevant statement was made by  , an Ukrinform correspondent reports. “Right from the start of the invasion, it has been a Danish priority that those responsible for the atrocities are held accountable. I am proud that with this project we can now, from the Danish side, help to ensure that evidence is collected for the investigation. It is absolutely essential to conduct trials and ultimately get the criminals convicted,” Kofod told. Denmark’s Foreign Affairs Ministry is allocating DKK 8 million to the Danish civil society organisation DIGNITY, which will lead this project. The project will focus on training Ukrainian civil society players in the proper methods of collecting and storing evidence to be used in the litigation of war crimes at national and international criminal courts. An emphasis will also be placed on handling victims and witnesses delicately so as not to revive trauma. “Together with our Ukrainian partners, we can make a concrete and positive difference in the midst of the horrors of war,” DIGNITY Director General Rasmus Grue noted. A reminder that the Government of Denmark contributed DKK 25 million (USD 3.6 million) to protect women and girls’ health and rights in Ukraine and Moldova. mk

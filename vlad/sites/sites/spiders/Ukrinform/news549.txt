Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head of the Ukrainian President's Office, has reacted to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's promise to fight for the lifting of sanctions against Russia, noting that Hungary is a "Trojan horse" that seeks the collapse of the European Union at the expense of European taxpayers.

According to Ukrinform, Podolyak said this on  . "Orban says that he will fight for the lifting of sanctions against Russia. Let's call a spade a spade. Hungary â€“ Trojan horse seeking the collapse of the EU at the expense of European taxpayers," he said. Podolyak added that Orban hates Ukraine and dreams of "Russian peace" in Europe. "Should the EU finance these subversive acts?" he added. In his speech at a closed-door meeting with members of the Hungarian government and representatives of local authorities in the village of Kotcse on September 10, Orban said the war in Ukraine could last until 2030, and by that time, in his opinion, the European Union will allegedly collapse. He also said he would try to prevent the EU from extending sanctions against Russia for a further six months.

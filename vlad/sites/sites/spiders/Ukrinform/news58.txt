Just 0.5% of local residents took part in the so-called ‘pseudo-referendum’ held by Russian invaders within the temporarily occupied areas of the Zaporizhzhia region between September 23, 2022 and September 27, 2022.

The relevant statement was made by Melitopol Mayor Ivan Fedorov on  , an Ukrinform correspondent reports. Fedorov thanked Melitopol residents for their steadfast resistance to the enemy. “Even under the enemy’s oppression, you did not take part in that mockery and sham referendum. Just 0.5% participated in that fake show,” Fedorov told. In his words, none of civilized countries will recognize either holding or the results of such fake ‘voting’. According to Fedorov, the Ukrainian government will continue to pay pensions and salaries to public sector workers and ensure all the social benefits for those remaining within the temporarily occupied areas. A reminder that Russian occupiers announced the fabricated results of the sham referenda held on September 23-27, 2022. Russian invaders claim that over 97% of voters across the occupied areas of Ukraine ‘supported’ accession to Russia (93% in the Zaporizhzhia region). mk

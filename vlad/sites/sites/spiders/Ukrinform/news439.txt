Kornet anti-tank missile launcher is among the latest shipments,” the press service of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine posted on  . It is noted that when the invaders saw the marines advancing on their positions in the south of Ukraine, they fled out of fear to the "deep rear", leaving the anti-tank missile system. "The marines are generous warriors and will definitely return the missiles to their owners, burning several enemy tanks down with them," the Naval Forces added. As reported, on October 8, the Ukrainian marines eliminated more than 30 Russian invaders, while artillery units eliminated 20 Russian soldiers and equipment. ol

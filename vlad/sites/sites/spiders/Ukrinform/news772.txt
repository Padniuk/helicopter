"There is a realistic possibility that mobilization will be used to reinforce Rosgvardia units with additional manpower," the ministry said. It added that Russia's National Guard "was particularly ill-prepared for the intense fighting it has experienced in Ukraine." "With a requirement to quell growing domestic dissent in Russia, as well as operational taskings in Ukraine, Rosgvardia is highly likely under particular strain," the agency added. The Ministry of Defense said that Rosgvardia units "have played an important role in both combat and rear-area security in Ukraine and are currently facilitating accession referendums in occupied areas." On Wednesday, September 21, Russian President Vladimir Putin in a special video address announced that he had signed a decree on partial mobilization. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said that 300,000 reservists would be called up as part of the partial mobilization.

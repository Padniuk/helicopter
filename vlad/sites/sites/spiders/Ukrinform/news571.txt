The Russian army has lost at least four warplanes over the past 10 days, and about 55 since the beginning of the invasion.

“Russia has highly likely lost at least four combat jets in Ukraine within the last 10 days, taking its attrition to approximately 55 since the start of the invasion,” reads the intelligence update on Ukraine of the UK’s Ministry of Defence as of September 19 posted on  . According to the British intelligence estimate, the uptick in losses is partially a result of the Russian Air Force accepting greater risk as it attempts to provide close air support to Russian ground forces under pressure from Ukrainian advances. “Russian pilots’ situational awareness is often poor; there is a realistic possibility that some aircraft have strayed over enemy territory and into denser air defence zones as the front lines have moved rapidly,” reads the report. It is also noted that Russia’s continued lack of air superiority remains one of the most important factors underpinning the fragility of its operational design in Ukraine. As reported, according to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Russian army lost 251 aircraft in Ukraine from February 24 to September 18. ol

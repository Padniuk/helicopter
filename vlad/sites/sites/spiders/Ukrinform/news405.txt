In Vasylivka, Zaporizhzhia region, about 6,000 cars are waiting in line for evacuation at a Russian checkpoint. The invaders said they had a "weekend" and did not let the cars go.

"There were 6,000 cars in Vasylivka â€“ the only town that linked the temporarily occupied territories to Ukraine-controlled territory, in the morning. They [Russians] let about 100 cars move to the last checkpoint when they were stopped and told that Saturday and Sunday were weekend," Melitopol Mayor Ivan Fedorov said during the nationwide news telethon, Ukrinform reports. According to him, people blocked by invaders have been living in cars for 10 days. ol

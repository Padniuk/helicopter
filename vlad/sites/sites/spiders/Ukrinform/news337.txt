Not a single oil dollar must be spent on Russia's war against Ukraine and the entire civilized world.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said this in his nightly  , Ukrinform reports. "We must ensure that the terrorist state does not receive any profit from the sale of oil and gas. So that not a single oil dollar and not a single gas euro could go to the continuation of the Russian war against Ukraine and the entire civilized world," Zelensky said. He noted that the European Union is preparing for the introduction of the eighth package of sanctions, which provides for restrictions on the sea transportation of Russian oil and the creation of a toolkit to limit the oil revenues of the terrorist state. However, Zelensky said that this should be only the beginning of sanctions pressure on Russia's energy resources in order to force the aggressor to stop the war. He noted that Ukraine would continue working in this direction tomorrow thanks to the appeals to the participants of the European Council meeting. He also thanked "all in the free world, who work for this result, promote the necessary political decisions and create the necessary economic alternatives to Russian energy resources."

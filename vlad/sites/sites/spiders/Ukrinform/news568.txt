To get concessions in energy blackmail, Russia puts the world on the brink of a nuclear disaster.

"In desperation, Russia puts the world on the brink of a nuclear disaster to get at least some concessions in its energy blackmail of Europe," Minister of Energy of Ukraine German Galushchenko commented on the shelling of the South Ukraine NPP on  . He praised the resilience of Europe in countering Russia's energy aggression. However, according to the minister, the need to stop Russian nuclear terror in Ukraine requires double efforts. "The world must finally retaliate against the terrorist state. It is not too late and a nuclear disaster is only a threat which, unfortunately, is becoming more and more real every day," Galushchenko emphasized. As reported, the Russians struck the industrial area of the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant at night â€“ a missile fell 300 m away from the reactors. As a result of the shelling, the NPP premises were damaged, more than 100 windows were broken. One of the hydraulic units of the Oleksandrivka HPP, which is part of the South Ukraine energy complex, shut down. Three high-voltage power lines were also disconnected. Russian missiles have repeatedly flown dangerously close to the South Ukraine NPP. ol

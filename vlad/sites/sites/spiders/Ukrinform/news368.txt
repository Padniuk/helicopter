French President Emmanuel Macron has announced the creation of a special fund for the purchase of weapons intended for Ukraineâ€™s Armed Forces and the possibility of delivering another six Caesar howitzers.

The president spoke at a press conference in Prague, an Ukrinform correspondent reports. "To this special fund, 100 million euros was initially allocated, to be able to purchase equipment that matches what we have already been able to deliver. Therefore, we continue to work on the same category of defensive weaponry," Macron said. Also, according to the president, France is in negotiations, in particular, with Danish partners, about the supply of Caesar guns to Ukraine. The discussion concerning certain technical aspects is in its final stretch. "In any case, we are ready for this, we are ready for co-financing, and this will make it possible to supply several units of the Caesar artillery system, which has proven effective. Six of them," Macron said. As Ukrinform reported earlier, on October 6, Macron said France was considering sending Ukraine more Caesar guns.

A burial site with more than 50 graves of civilians was found in the recently liberated Lyman of Donetsk region.

According to Ukrinform, this was reported by   from the scene. â€œThe Russians dug trenches and forced people, whom they suspected of collaborating with the Ukrainian military, to collect the bodies of the dead for reburial," report says. A boy, who was also detained by the invaders and was forced to bury the bodies, told reporters that not all buried bodies were identified. The bodies could lie on the streets for a long time. In addition, those who were killed by shelling were sometimes buried by their neighbors. In addition, the invaders did not remove the bodies of their soldiers. Thus, Russians lived in one of the houses and organized a medical center there. When they retreated, they took the wounded and left the dead. The burial site contains more than 50 graves of civilians. Some graves are marked with name plates, and some are only numbered. As Ukrinform reported, on October 1, the Armed Forces of Ukraine liberated Lyman from the Russian invaders and took control of the town. On October 4, the Ukrainian national flag was officially raised over the liberated Lyman. iy

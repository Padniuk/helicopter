Liberation of the town of Lyman from Russian invaders, who are now pocketed in the area, will be the beginning of de-occupation of the entire Luhansk region.

That’s according to Serhiy  , chief of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration, Ukrinform reports. "After the liberation of Lyman, we expect the beginning of the de-occupation of Luhansk region; the occupiers themselves are posting on social media the videos where they say their military command had left them behind to their fate," Haidai noted. The administration head is convinced that the holding of sham referenda in no way affects the developments at the front lines as the Armed Forces of Ukraine are confidently advancing. "Yesterday in the President’s Office, several issues were discussed. With the de-occupation of each settlement, we will immediately engage in restoring normal life there," Haidai summarized. As Ukrinform reported earlier, referring to the Luhansk Regional Military Administration, as of the morning of October 1, Russian military based in Lyman asked their commanders to allow withdrawal from the area but their appeals were turned down. More than 5,000 Russian troops are believed to have been encircled by Ukraine’s forces.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has not yet commented on its alleged involvement in explosions and fire on the Crimean Bridge.

A number of media outlets said the SBU was behind the explosions and fire on the bridge. At the same time, the special service on its  channel indirectly points to such involvement, with Ukrinform sources also testifying to this. At the same time, the SBU did not provide an official comment to Ukrinform. "We do not comment on this. We will comment on the role of the SBU or any government body of Ukraine in 'bavovna' [explosions] after our final victory," said SBU spokesman Artem Dekhtiarenko. On October 8, a fire broke out on the Crimean Bridge, which connects Russia and the temporarily occupied Ukrainian Crimea. A video posted on social media shows a train on the Kerch rail bridge ablaze, with the adjacent road bridge appearing to have sustained damage.

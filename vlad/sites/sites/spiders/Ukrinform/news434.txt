Since the beginning of active operations in Kherson region, the Ukrainian troops have liberated more than 1,170 square kilometers of our land.

"As of today, more than 1,170 sq km have been liberated in Kherson direction since the beginning of active operations. Work is ongoing to gain a foothold in the territories, mop them up, carry out stabilization measures," Natalia Humeniuk, Spokesperson for the Operational Command "South", announced during the national news telethon. At the same time, the local residents are advised not to return immediately to the liberated territory as the invaders mine buildings, infrastructure facilities, roads, and fields while retreating. In addition, cluster munitions are scattered during strikes. "That's why you need to be careful and not rush to return to the liberated territories, give experts the opportunity to carry out appropriate stabilization measures to make your return safe," Humeniuk said. As reported, the Russian Federation tries to improve supply lines on the right bank of Kherson region, but the Armed Forces of Ukraine fire on the enemy's means of crossing. ol

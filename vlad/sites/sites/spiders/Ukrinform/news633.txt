British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace has said that Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision to declare a partial mobilization in Russia is an admission that his plan to invade Ukraine is failing.

According to Ukrinform, Wallace said this in a statement made public by the UK Ministry of Defense on  . "President Putin's breaking of his own promises not to mobilize parts of his population and the illegal annexation of parts of Ukraine are an admission that his invasion is failing. He and his defense minister have sent tens of thousands of their own citizens to their deaths, ill equipped and badly led. No amount of threats and propaganda can hide the fact that Ukraine is winning this war, the international community are united and Russia is becoming a global pariah," Wallace said. On September 21, Putin announced a partial mobilization in Russia. After his video address, the stock market in Russia collapsed by 10%, and direct flights from Russia to Yerevan and Istanbul were sold out.

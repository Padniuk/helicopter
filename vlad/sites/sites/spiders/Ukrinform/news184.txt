The Russian invaders took 76 more orphans from the captured Luhansk region to the Russian Federation.

"The occupiers continue to irrevocably take children out of Luhansk region. Another 76 orphans were transferred to Russian social rehabilitation centers for minors located in Moscow region," Serhiy Haidai, Head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration, posted on  . According to Haidai, "currently, four regions of Russia have to accept them as part of family groups." In addition, he noted,104 more children who now stay in social institutions of the so-called "LPR" will soon be transferred to Russian families. "This allows the occupiers to reduce the generation gap, especially among the male population which is growing daily along with the number of fallen soldiers," Haidai added.

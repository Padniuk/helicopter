Russian President Vladimir Putin accusing Ukraine of being involved in damaging the Crimean Bridge, as well as calling the incident a terror attack, is too cynical of a move.

That’s according to Mykhailo  , an adviser to the head of the Ukrainian President’s Office, Ukrinform reports. “Putin accuses Ukraine of terrorism? Sounds too cynical even for Russia. Less than 24 hours ago ru-planes hit residential area of Zaporizhzhia with 12 missiles, killing 13 people and injuring more than 50. There is only one terrorist state here and the whole world knows who it is,” Podolyak tweeted Sunday. As reported, on the morning of October 8, an explosion and a massive fire were recorded on the Kerch Strait Bridge connecting mainland Russia and the temporarily occupied Crimea. A freight train was seen engulfed in flames on the railway section of the bridge, while part of the bridge collapsed altogether on the motorway part. The adviser to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, Mykhailo Podolyak, commenting on the incident, said it was a manifestation of the conflict between the FSB plus private military companies and the Ministry of Defense plus General Staff. On October 9, there were reports of several kilometers-long traffic jams near the Crimean Bridge. According to local residents, the crossing remains open only for trucks, while all traffic on the bridge goes along a single intact lane.

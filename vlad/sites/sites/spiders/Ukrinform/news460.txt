A projectile struck a building in the center of Kherson, where both the so-called "government" of the invaders and the "military-civilian administration" were located.

Serhiy Khlan, a deputy of the Kherson Regional Council,   this in a Facebook post, Ukrinform reports. "In Kherson, [a projectile] hit a court’s building, where the so-called ‘government’ of the occupiers and the ‘military-civilian administration’ of the traitors were located," the report reads. Each such hit brings the victory closer, noted the regional council deputy. Khlan also called on Kherson residents not to walk near the facilities where the invaders are located. According to Kherson political scientist Volodymyr Molchanov, this is the building where, before the Russian occupation of the city, the court of appeals had been located.

The invaders are building a "state border" in Vasylivka, Zaporizhzhia region, the only settlement through which it is possible to leave the temporarily captured territories of Ukraine for Zaporizhzhia city.

"In Vasylivka, they are trying to set up a ‘state border’, as they believe, with all the crossing rules they invented. Men of conscription age are not allowed [to cross it]. Transit from the occupied territory has been stopped on both sides. The occupiers try to build a ‘border’ as they once did in Crimea and Donbas," Oleksandr Starukh, Head of the Zaporizhzhia Regional Military Administration, said during the nationwide news telethon, Ukrinform reports. He added that only 43 people had managed to leave the temporarily captured territories of Ukraine through Vasylivka over the past day, while last week this figure had reached 1,500-2,000 people per day. As reported, the enemy army continues to shell the civilian infrastructure facilities in Zaporizhzhia region. Only yesterday, 114 strikes were launched, 90 of which targeted civilian objects located in 23 settlements of the region. One person was injured. ol

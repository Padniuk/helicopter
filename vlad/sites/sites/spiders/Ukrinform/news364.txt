Ukraine has captured at least 440 enemy main battle tanks and nearly 650 other armored combat vehicles since the full-scale invasion by Russia, which means more than half of the current panzer fleet consists of captured equipment.

That’s according to the  , referring to its intelligence, Ukrinform reports. "Re-purposed captured Russian equipment now makes up a large portion of Ukraine's military hardware. Ukraine has likely captured at least 440 Russian Main Battle Tanks, and around 650 other armoured vehicles since the invasion. Over half of Ukraine's currently fielded tank fleet potentially consists of captured vehicles” reads the latest intelligence update on the Russian war in Ukraine, posted by the British Defense Ministry on Twitter October 7. Also, British intelligence points to the failure of the Russian crews to destroy intact equipment before leaving behind or surrendering, which "highlights their poor state of training and low level of battle discipline." "With Russian formations under severe strain in several sectors and increasingly demoralized troops, Russia will likely continue to lose heavy weaponry," the intelligence update concludes. As Ukrinform reported earlier, according to the latest estimates released by the General Staff of Ukraine’s Armed Forces, Russia’s military death toll in Ukraine currently stands at nearly 61,000, with over 2,400 tanks and over 5,000 armored combat vehicles confirmed as destroyed in action.

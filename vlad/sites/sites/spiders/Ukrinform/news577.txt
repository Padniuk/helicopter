The press service of the main directorate of the National Police in the Kharkiv region reported this on its  channel, according to Ukrinform. "A multi-story building came under enemy fire. A 64-year-old retired soldier of the Russian Federation, who had been living in the city for the past few years, died," the report said. Employees of the agency documented the fact of Russia's armed aggression and collected material evidence. Criminal proceedings have been instituted under Part 2 of Article 438 (violation of the laws and customs of war) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. Vovchansk was captured by Russian troops on the first day of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and liberated on September 11 during a large-scale counter-offensive by the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

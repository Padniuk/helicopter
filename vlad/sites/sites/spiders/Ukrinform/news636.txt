Demining efforts within the Kharkiv region’s areas, which have recently been liberated from Russian invaders, will last for months.

The relevant statement was made by Advisor to Ukrainian Internal Affairs Minister Vadym Denysenko in a commentary to Ukrinform. “Here, we can make an analogy with what had been happening in the Kyiv region, first of all. Deminers have such a rule that one day of war is equal to a month of demining efforts. By analogy, for example, with Bucha and Irpin, we realize this will take us months,” Denysenko told. In his words, it is difficult to announce more precise time limits. Some places are easier for deminers to work through, while the other areas are more contaminated with mines. A reminder that, on September 12, 2022, Ukrainian Internal Affairs Minister Denys Monastyrskyi noted that the recently liberated areas of the Kharkiv region were more contaminated with explosives than the de-occupied areas of the Kyiv region and the Sumy region. mk

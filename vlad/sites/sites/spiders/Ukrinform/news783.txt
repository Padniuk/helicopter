Less than 60,000 people have remained in the temporarily occupied city of Melitopol, and Russian invaders managed to force just 20% of them to vote at a pseudo-referendum.

The relevant statement was made by Melitopol Mayor Ivan Fedorov during a nationwide  , an Ukrinform correspondent reports. “Less than 60,000 out of 150,000 residents are now remaining within the temporarily occupied city of Melitopol and held hostage by Russia. For three days, the occupiers have been trying to hold a sham referendum but failing. However, this will have little effect, because we understand the results have already been drawn,” Fedorov told. The sham referendum was launched on September 23, and Russians have managed to force just 20% of Melitopol residents to vote since then. “Out of this 20%, only 10% voted in favor of the Russian Federation. We understand they voted against their will, under pressure, at gunpoint,” Fedorov added. According to Fedorov, the pseudo-referendum held by Russian invaders is part of Russia’s information war aimed at forcible mobilization. mk

Ukraine’s air defense forces have already destroyed 64 enemy drones.

"We have downed almost 64 drones against 24 strikes. We know what and how they can damage, how they are used and how to counter them," Natalia Humeniuk, Spokesperson for the Operational Command "South", announced during the national news telethon.

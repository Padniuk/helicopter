Russian President Vladimir Putin signed decrees recognizing Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions as "independent territories" after pseudo-referendums were held there.

The decrees were published by the   propaganda media outlet, Ukrinform reports. Putin justifies his acts of aggression by "universally recognized principles and norms of international law" which are enshrined in the UN charter. Putin's decrees on the recognition of the independence of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions "enter into force" on September 29. As reported, on September 23-27, the Russian-occupation administration held sham referenda in the territory of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia regions on accession of these territories to Russia. ol

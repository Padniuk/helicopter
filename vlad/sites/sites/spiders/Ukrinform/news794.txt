The haste with which Russia is conducting the mobilization effort suggests that many of the drafted troops will deploy to the front line in Ukraine with minimum preparation.

That's according to the  update, Ukrinform reports.  “The initial tranches of men called up under Russia's partial mobilization have started arriving at military bases. Many tens of thousands of call-ups papers have already been issued. Russia will now face an administrative and logistical challenge to provide training for the troops,” the intelligence update reads. Unlike most Western armies, the Russian military provides low-level, initial training to soldiers within their designated operational units rather than in dedicated training establishments, the report notes. Typically one battalion within each Russian brigade will remain in garrison if the other two deploy and can provide a cadre of instructors to train new recruits and augmentees, it is reported. However, Russia has deployed many of these third battalions to Ukraine, the British Defense Ministry says. “Many of the drafted troops will not have had any military experience for some years. The lack of military trainers, and the haste with which Russia has started the mobilisation, suggests that many of the drafted troops will deploy to the front line with minimum relevant preparation. They are likely to suffer a high attrition rate,” the report concludes.

A member of Vladimir Putin's inner circle has voiced disagreement directly to the Russian president in recent weeks over his handling of the war in Ukraine, according to information obtained by U.S. intelligence.

That's according to  , Ukrinform reports. "The criticism marks the clearest indication yet of turmoil within Russia’s leadership over the stewardship of a war that has gone disastrously wrong for Moscow, forcing Putin last month to order the mobilization of hundreds of thousands of troops in a desperate bid to reverse recent battlefield losses," the article reads. The information was deemed significant enough that it was included in President Joe Biden’s daily intelligence briefing and shared with other U.S. officials, according to people familiar with the matter. The discontent that the member of Putin’s inner circle expressed related to what the insider considered mismanagement of the war effort and mistakes being made by those executing the military campaign, according to one of the people. The new intelligence, coupled with comments from Russian officials, underscores divisions within Putin’s upper echelon, where officials have long been loath to bring bad news to an autocratic Russian leader. "Since the start of the occupation we have witnessed growing alarm from a number of Putin's inner circle. Our assessments suggest they are particularly exercised by recent Russian losses, misguided direction and extensive military shortcomings," a Western intelligence official said. A second senior Western official said the internal tensions are "consistent with the way in which the campaign has gone for the Russians, and the atmospherics in the Kremlin." "There are a lot of people who are convinced this isn't going well or the right course of action," the official said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov acknowledged there have been disagreements and debates among Russian leaders as Putin has faced crucial decisions such as the mobilization.

Russia must not be allowed to turn the war into a protracted conflict so all the required weapons must be supplied to the nation that is defending itself in order to help it win.

That’s according to the former commander of the US European Command (2014-2017), General Frederick Ben Hodges, who now serves as a military expert with the Center for European Policy Studies, who spoke with  , Ukrinform reports. “That’s exactly the approach we should be taking. Don’t let it become a protracted conflict. And so that’s why there are many of us who are advocating ‘give Ukraine what’s needed in quantities to help them finish this before it becomes a protracted conflict,” Ben Hodges said. “I know that the administration and other governments are trying to figure out how to do all this. I don’t completely agree with the administration’s approach that there are still apparently some limitations (on arms supplies to Ukraine - ed.). There’s no doubt that everyone in the Biden administration wants Ukraine to be successful, wants to see Ukraine achieve restoration of all of its territorial integrity but there’s still this one part I think that believes somehow that you can actually negotiate with Russia. These are good people, they’re concerned about what happens to nuclear weapons, they’re concerned about escalation, I get that, I just personally disagree with that,” the general explained. As reported earlier, French Senator Melanie Vogel (The Greens) said France and other countries with a substantial military potential must supply as much weaponry as possible to Ukraine to help the nation win the war as soon as possible.

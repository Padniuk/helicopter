The Russian army, which is increasing in size since Russian President Putin announced a “partial” military mobilization, is now facing growing problems with medical provision.

According to Ukrinform, the UK Ministry of Defense said this in an intelligence   on Friday. “Medical provision for Russian combat troops in Ukraine is probably growing worse. Some newly mobilised Russian reservists have been ordered to source their own combat first aid supplies, with the advice that female sanitary products are a cost-effective solution. Medical training and first-aid awareness is likely poor,” the report reads. According to the British Ministry of Defense, some Russia troops have obtained “their own modern, Western-style combat torniquets but have stowed them on their equipment using cable-ties, rather than with the Velcro provided - probably because such equipment is scarce and liable to be pilfered”. “This is almost certain to hamper or render impossible the timely application of torniquet care in the case of catastrophic bleeding on the battlefield,” the report reads. The British Ministry of Defense added that Russian troops’ lack of confidence in sufficient medical provision is “almost certainly contributing to a declining state of morale and a lack of willingness to undertake offensive operations in many units in Ukraine”. As Ukrinform reported, according to data provided by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, over 100,000 people have been called up in Russia. iy

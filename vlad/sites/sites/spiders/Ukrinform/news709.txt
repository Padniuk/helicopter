The UN's Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine confirmed that there were cases of executions and ill-treatment by the Russian military in Bucha, Kyiv region.

According to an Ukrinform correspondent, this was announced by Erik Mose, Chair of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, at a press conference in Geneva on Friday. In particular, Mose said that Bucha was one of the places where evidence was gathered about cases of executions and ill-treatment before the execution. He also said that the Commission intends to investigate reports of mass burials in Izium, Kharkiv region, which was liberated from the Russian invaders. According to him, at the current stage of the investigation, the Commission has not yet identified the individuals involved in the violations in Ukraine. Their names, if identified, will be included in the overall final report in March 2023. Commission member Pablo de Greiff said that currently the Commission is "somewhere in the middle of its path", and further investigations will continue in other territories of Ukraine, adding that the Commission will broaden its inquiries. At the same time, he pointed out that, due to the position of the Russian Federation, the Commission still cannot gain access to the Ukrainian territories occupied by Russian forces. On September 23, the UN's Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine reported to the UN Human Rights Council said that it had established that war crimes had been committed by Russian forces in Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy regions of Ukraine. iy

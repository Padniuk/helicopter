This is reported by Ukrinform with reference to Operational Command  . The enemy continues their efforts to hold on to the defensive lines but, under the influence of our pro-active moves, they are forced to set up new ones, which are farther away from the current front line. “The Armed Forces of Ukraine carried out preparatory work on the identification of control points, enemy weapons and equipment clusters, and locations where the reserves are being drawn to, including by rail, from the temporarily occupied Crimea. Fire control is established over these locations,” the statement reads. Ukraine’s Air Force carried out 20 strikes.

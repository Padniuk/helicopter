The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) is investigating the fact of shooting by the Russian troops of a convoy of civilian cars in the Kupiansk district of Kharkiv region.

The SBU said this in a Facebook  , Ukrinform reports. "At the end of September, the rashists struck a convoy of seven cars. At least 20 people, including 10 children, were killed. A brutal attack on civilians was carried out by the occupiersâ€™ sabotage and reconnaissance group - they used small arms to shoot six old cars and one Gazelle truck at close range. The enemy once again proved that their goal is the elimination of all Ukrainians, regardless of age and gender. The occupiers are defeated on the battlefield, and out of desperation, they kill civilians in response. But the rashists will not escape punishment - we will find everyone and they will be held accountable for the atrocities committed," said acting SBU Head Vasyl Maliuk. As noted, the total number of victims is currently being specified, relevant examinations are being conducted. Several people managed to escape, so they are giving evidence to the investigators. The identities of the citizens killed by the Russian soldiers are being checked, comprehensive documentation and collection of evidence of this crime for the International Criminal Court is underway. As reported, in the Kupiansk district of Kharkiv region, a convoy of civilian cars came under enemy fire. According to preliminary data, at least 20 people were found dead in their cars. iy

None of the Iranian-manufactured suicide drones launched at the city of Mykolaiv has reached the target so far, as the Armed Forces of Ukraine are successfully shooting them down.

The relevant statement was made by Mykolaiv Regional Military Administration Head Vitalii Kim during a briefing at Media Center Ukraine, an Ukrinform correspondent reports. “We already have a certain number of the Iranian suicide drones shot down. None of them reached objects in the city of Mykolaiv. In addition, over the past day, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have shot down an Orlan-10 UAV. According to the South Operational Command, the effective ways of fighting against such drones are now being developed,” Kim told. In his words, last night Russian troops struck downtown Mykolaiv with different weapons. “Last night, around 01:00 a.m. and 04:00 a.m., the enemy struck Mykolaiv with different weapons. Two rockets were launched with the Tornado-S multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) and four missiles with the S-300 systems. Two more missiles hit an adjacent settlement, causing damage to a public transport stop and several civilian buildings. Generally, no casualties were reported,” Kim noted. A reminder that eight apartment blocks, a number of stores and a city exhibition hall were damaged in an explosion, which rocked downtown Mykolaiv last night. mk

Neither sham "referendums" nor hybrid "mobilization" in Russia will change anything, as Ukraine has every right to liberate its territories and will continue to liberate them.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said this on  , Ukrinform reports. "Sham 'referendums' will not change anything. Neither will any hybrid 'mobilization.' Russia has been and remains an aggressor illegally occupying parts of Ukrainian land. Ukraine has every right to liberate its territories and will keep liberating them whatever Russia has to say," Kuleba said. Earlier reports said that militants from the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics ("DNR" and "LNR") had called on their leaders to hold pseudo-referendums on "joining the Russian Federation." The so-called public council, created with Russia's participation in the temporarily occupied territory of the Kherson region to prepare a pseudo-referendum on joining the Russian Federation, also made a corresponding appeal to the invading authorities.

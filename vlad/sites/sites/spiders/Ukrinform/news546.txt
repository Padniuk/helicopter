Having faced setbacks on the front lines, Russia has intensified strikes on the civilian infrastructure across Ukraine attempting to undermine the morale of the Ukrainian people and government.

“Russia has launched several thousand long-range missiles against Ukraine since 24 February 2022. However, in the last seven days, Russia has increased its targeting of civilian infrastructure even where it probably perceives no immediate military effect,” reads the report of the UK’s Ministry of Defence published on  . As noted, this category of mission has included strikes against the electricity grid, and a dam on the Inhulets River at Kryvyi Rih. “As it faces setbacks on the front lines, Russia has likely extended the locations it is prepared to strike in an attempt to directly undermine the morale of the Ukrainian people and government,” the Ministry added. As reported, the Ukrainian troops have liberated about 8,500 square kilometers of territory, up to 388 settlements, and almost 150,000 people from the Russian invaders in Kharkiv region since September 6. In response, the Russian army intensified the shelling of civilian objects in Ukraine. In particular, on the evening of September 11, the enemy fired 11 cruise missiles at critical infrastructure facilities across Ukraine. The strikes caused power outages in several regions. On September 14, Russian troops hit Kryvyi Rih and its outskirts with Kh-101 cruise missiles from aircraft. During the massive missile attack on Kryvyi Rih, the Russians hit critical and transport infrastructure facilities and seriously damaged hydraulic structures. ol

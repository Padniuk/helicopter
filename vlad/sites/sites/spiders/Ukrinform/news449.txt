As the rubble is being further cleared on the sites of the Russian deadly missile attack on the residential areas in Zaporizhia overnight Sunday, at least 14 civilians have been confirmed dead.

President Volodymyr  announced this in an address to the nation on Sunday, Ukrinform reports. "This night, as a result of Russian strikes on ordinary residential buildings in Zaporizhia, at least 14 people were killed. Unfortunately, the death toll may increase as strike site clearance is still ongoing," Zelensky said. The president added that the night's strikes were the latest in a series of Russian attacks on Zaporizhzhia, which have already killed at least 43 people since October 3. "And there were also strikes on Kharkiv, the cities of Donbas, and other cities across Ukraine... There were also strikes by Iranian drones, and airstrikes," the president added. Zelensky emphasized that the absolute majority of these attacks targeted civilian infrastructure and civilian residents. Constant terror against the civilian population testifies to Russiaâ€™s obvious refusal from real negotiations, Zelensky emphasized. The Ukrainian leader added that terror is a crime that must be punished. State-sponsored terror is one of the most terrible international crimes, which threatens not someone particular but the entire international community, the president added. Zelensky also thanked everyone who helps Ukraine repel terror and those who fight and work for peace to return to Ukraine. As reported, on the night of October 9, the invaders attacked the residential quarters of Zaporizhia, launching S-300 and Kh-22 missiles. Dozens of households, two apartment buildings, and other civilian infrastructure came under fire. Tentative reports said at least 13 were killed in the attack, while 60 were injured, including six children.

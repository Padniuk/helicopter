The exhumation of the bodies of those who were killed in shelling and tortured to death by Russian troops will last about two weeks.

The relevant statement was made by Izium Mayor Valerii Marchenko during a nationwide telethon, an Ukrinform correspondent reports. “This work will last for about two more weeks, as there are too many victims buried,” Marchenko told. The exhumed bodies are transported to Kharkiv for further examination. According to the preliminary data, more burial sites of those who had fallen victims to the Russian terror are likely to be discovered. Marchenko noted local residents who had left the city are now applying to government agencies to search for their missing relatives. A reminder that, on September 16, 2022, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky noted over 400 bodies, including those with signs of torture, had been found at the mass burial site in the liberated city of Izium. Ukrainian servicemen and children were among them. As of September 17, 2022, a total of 59 bodies were exhumed by the National Police of Ukraine. According to the law enforcement agencies, eleven torture chambers have already been discovered within the Kharkiv region’s areas liberated from Russian invaders, and six of them – in the city of Izium. mk

A series of blasts rocked the temporarily captured Melitopol over the past three days, in the area where Russian military bases are located. This morning, a depot exploded where the enemy had been storing ammunition and equipment for about a month.

That’s according to Melitopol Mayor Ivan Fedorov, who spoke at the national news telethon, Ukrinform reports. "For the last three days, explosions have been heard in the city and district. For example, today at 4 a.m. there was an explosion in a village 20 km from the city of Melitopol. According to our information, it’s a warehouse where enemy ammunition and military equipment had been stored for about a month. The detonation is continuing even now," he said. Fedorov also recalled that yesterday, there were explosions at the Russian-held airfield in Melitopol. A military base of the invasion forces is also located there. The security situation in the temporarily occupied city is worsening, therefore civilians are trying to flee the area. According to the mayor, two tragic events related to the evacuation effort occurred in recent days. "An enemy truck caused a traffic accident involving a Slavuta passenger car, in which the family was traveling. The family died, and the ammunition detonated in the truck. Another family was blown up on an enemy mine in Vasylivka just yesterday," Fedorov said. Earlier, it was reported that the occupiers are trying to identify school children who continue to study online under the Ukrainian curriculum.

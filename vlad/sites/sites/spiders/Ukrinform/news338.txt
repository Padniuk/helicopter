French President Emmanuel Macron said that France was looking into providing Ukraine with new Caesar self-propelled guns.

The leader touched upon the issue during a Q&A following the European Union summit, an Ukrinform correspondent reports. "We are discussing this topic in relation to several mechanisms, but we are indeed working on several requests with several EU member states, in particular, regarding the new Caesars," Macron said. "We will continue to support Ukraine from the financial, humanitarian, and military perspectives," the French president said. Macron added that this would involve assistance in terms of equipment and training â€“ continuing what France has already been engaged in for several months. He noted that the movement in this direction will continue based on requests that have been formulated and very closely agreed with both members of the European Union and non-EU nations, in particular, the United Kingdom. As earlier reported by the French mass media, France is preparing to deliver more  guns to Ukraine.

More than 11 settlements in Ukraine came under Russian fire throughout the day. The Armed Forces repelled enemy attacks near five towns and villages.

That’s according to the   of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Ukrinform reports. "The enemy launched three missile and five air strikes, and carried out more than 16 attacks employing multiple rocket launchers. In addition, the enemy flew unmanned aerial vehicles to strike infrastructure objects. More than 11 settlements were subjected to enemy strikes. These are Bakhmut, Trudove, Bohoyavlenka, Novoukrainka, Zaliznychne, Illinka, Nikopol, Blahodativka, Mykolaiv, Ochakiv, and Odesa," the message reads. Throughout the day, Ukraine’s Defense Forces repelled enemy attacks in the areas of Kozacha Lopan, Bakhmut, Vesela Dolyna, Zaytseve, and Pervomaiske. It is noted that in the temporarily captured territory of Ukraine, Russian occupation authorities, grossly violating the rules of warfare and human rights, intensified the forcible mobilization of conscription-age male population to replenish depleted units. In order to meet call-up deadlines and suppress local resistance, additional units of the Russian Guard were deployed in Berdiansk and Melitopol. As reported, since the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have already eliminated about 59,610 Russian troops.

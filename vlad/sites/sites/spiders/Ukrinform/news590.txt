The Operational Command South said this in a Facebook   Ukrinform reports. "The situation in our operational area remains steadily tense, but under our control. The enemy continues to focus efforts on defense organization and attempts to keep control of captured territories.

In some directions, the enemy is taking measures to regroup its units, deploy reserves, and activate air reconnaissance," the report reads.

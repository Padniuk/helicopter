Eighty-seven people, including 10 children, were injured in the night attack on Zaporizhzhia city.

"Eighty-seven people, including 10 children, were injured. Fifty-five people remained in the hospital... They [Russians] have been shelling the region every day since the beginning of the war, starting to reach Zaporizhzhia city recently. If earlier the shots could somehow be explained, now this is a pure terror," Oleksandr Starukh, Head of the Zaporizhzhia Regional Military Administration, said during the nationwide news telethon. The official noted that the Russian troops had fired 12 missiles, including Kh-22 and Kh-59, from planes. He is convinced that the invaders knew that they were shelling residential areas. "They couldn't be unaware what they were firing at, that is, they fired purposefully at residential buildings," he emphasized. Works to eliminate the consequences of the missile attack are ongoing. There are people under the rubble, but their number is unknown. In addition, Starukh said, the invaders fired an Iskander missile with cluster munitions at the city yesterday evening, around 10 p.m. Munitions got scattered at an infrastructure facility. One person was killed, three more were injured. As reported, on the night of October 9, the invaders attacked the residential quarters of Zaporizhzhia city with S-300 and Kh-22 missiles. Dozens of private houses, two apartment blocks and other civilian infrastructure of the city came under fire. According to the police data, 13 people were killed and 60 people were hospitalized. Children are among the killed and injured. ol

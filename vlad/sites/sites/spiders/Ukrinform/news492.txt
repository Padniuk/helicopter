A Russian serviceman has complained that there is no one to pick up what’s left of his unit after a successful attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

That’s according to the latest intercepted call made public by the  of Ukraine’s Defense Ministry, Ukrinform reports. "When you get to speak with the battalion commander, tell him there’s no officers left here, no one. We were abandoned here, there are 10 of us, we have no equipment, nothing. If someone’s going to get us out of here, they’ll need to send in an APC. We were left behind like dogs," the invader is heard telling his interlocutor. The Russian soldier also described how a day earlier his unit had suffered 15 precision strikes inflicted by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The strike targeted the house in which the invaders were hiding. Earlier, the Ukrainian intelligence agency intercepted the call made by the Russian invader, who told his wife how he barely survived Ukrainian shelling.

Russia is manipulating the topic of negotiations in order to stop the liberation of Ukrainian territory and buy time to regroup its forces.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said this in his speech at a meeting of the European Council, Ukrinform reports, citing the   of the head of state. "To stop the liberation of Ukraine, Russia began to manipulate the topic of negotiations, and allegedly mentioned the dialogue, which it rejected, starting this war against Ukraine and against all of you, against all of Europe. It is obvious that Russia does not want any real negotiations. Because if it wanted to, it would have responded to dozens of our proposals and efforts. Russia just wants to save time. Wants to regroup forces. And accumulate resources. To strike again," the President said. He said that Russia cannot be allowed to do that. Zelensky called on Europeans to maintain political principles, especially now, when "Russian forces have finally [collapsed] on the battlefield, and our heroes are liberating Ukrainian land every day â€“ village after village, city after city." According to him, like everything else in Europe, security is not something you can get by giving up something or signing a treaty. "Security is a task. The task of expelling the occupier from the territory occupied by it. The task of holding murderers and executioners to account. The task of restoring the validity of the fundamental standards and conventions approved by the international community for all states without exception," Zelensky said. Zelensky earlier said he would not hold any talks with Russian President Putin.

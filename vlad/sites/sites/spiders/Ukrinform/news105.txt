Ukraine's agreement with the United States on the non-use of U.S.-supplied weapons for strikes on the targets in the territory of the Russian Federation applies only to HIMARS artillery systems, without extending to other types of weapons.

Thatâ€™s according to Ukrainian Ambassador to the USA Oksana Markarova, who spoke in an interview with  , Ukrinform reports. The ambassador commented on the statement issued earlier by Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov about Ukraine's commitment not to use Western weapons for attacks on Russia-based targets. When asked whether this restriction applies only to HIMARS or to all American weapons, Markarova said: "This applies specifically to HIMARS." As reported, back in August, Reznikov stated that Ukraine had an agreement with the United States that its forces would not employ the weapons provided by the United States and other partners on targets located on Russian soil.

The Armed Forces of Ukraine continue to conduct active hostilities in the Kherson region and are gaining a foothold within the liberated areas. Meanwhile, some settlements situated along the front line are under enemy fire.

The relevant statement was made by Head of the United Coordinating Press Center of the Southern Defense Forces Natalia Humeniuk during a nationwide telethon, an Ukrinform correspondent reports. “We continue conducting battles and gaining a foothold within the areas which have already been liberated and those that are still keeping the defense. Also, we continue working with local residents along the contact line, along the front line, in those settlements that are under enemy fire. About 45 settlements have been shelled over the past day, and this means the intensified fire may significantly harm the local population,” Humeniuk told, adding that evacuation efforts are being organized for civilians. According to Humeniuk, within the temporarily occupied areas, Russian invaders are inspecting households for men aged from 18 to 35 in order to call them up and replenish their military units.  mk

Russia has faced the problem of a shortage of munitions, in particular high-precision missiles, which leads them to employ missiles designed to shoot down aerial targets for strikes on ground objects.

The British Defense Ministry reported this on  , according to Ukrinform. As noted, on September 30, Russian troops attacked a convoy of civilian vehicles evacuating Zaporizhzhia. A Russian long-range air defense missile was likely used. "Russia's stock of such missiles is highly likely limited and is a high-value resource designed to shoot down modern aircraft and incoming missiles, rather than for use against ground targets. Its use in ground attack role has almost certainly been driven by overall munitions shortages, particularly longer-range precision missiles," British intelligence says. At the same time, attention is drawn to the fact that on the same day, Russian President Putin signed "annexation agreements " for the captured Ukrainian territories, including Zaporizhzhia region. "Russia is expending strategically valuable military assets in attempts to achieve tactical advantage and in the process is killing civilians it now claims are its own citizens," the report concludes. As reported, on September 30, Russian troops fired at a convoy of civilian vehicles evacuating Zaporizhzhia. The attack claimed 30 civilian lives, injuring nearly 90. The Minister of Internal Affairs, Denys Monastyrskyi, said the Russians had employed modernized S-300 missiles. On September 30, the Kremlin held a ceremony of "admission into Russia" of the puppet entities "DPR" and "LNP", as well as the territories of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine seized by the Russian army.

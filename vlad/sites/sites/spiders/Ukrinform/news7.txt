The United States is currently observing no signs of preparations for the use of nuclear weapons by Russian forces while taking Vladimir Putin’s latest threats “very seriously.”

That’s according to the White House spokesperson Karin Jean-Pierre, who spoke at a briefing, commenting on the latest developments in this regard, Ukrinform's own correspondent reports. "As far as any evidence or the chances — look, we haven’t seen that at this time,” the official said. At the same time, she emphasized that Washington takes this threat “very seriously.” "But we have not seen any reason to adjust our own nuclear posture at this time,” said the spokesperson. As Ukrinform reported, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in an interview with CBS News that the U.S. administration had warned the Kremlin in private communications about the grave consequences that the Russian Federation would face should it employ nuclear weapons against Ukraine.
